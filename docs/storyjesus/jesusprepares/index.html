Wait for Me here; watch with Me."</p><p>「我的靈魂悲傷得要死。 在這裡等我；和我一起看。」</p><p><br></p><center>💠</center><p><br><br> As Peter, James and John settled themselves where their Master had indicated, Jesus went further into the garden, His tumultuous emotions impelling Him to seek His Father in prayer.</p><p>當彼得、詹姆斯和約翰在他們的主人所指示的地方安頓下來時，耶穌進一步進入花園，他動盪的情緒促使他在祈禱中尋求他的父親。</p><p><br> He knew His Father -- God -- could do anything. Perhaps He might be spared from this terrible suffering...</p><p>他知道他的父親——上帝——可以做任何事情。 也許他可能會免於這種可怕的痛苦......</p><p><br></p><center>💠</center><p><br><br> He fell to the ground a distance away from the place where He had left His three most trusted companions.</p><p>倒在離他離開三個最信任的同伴的地方很遠的地方。</p><p><br> Now He was alone, in the presence of His Father.</p><p>現在他獨自一人，在他父親面前。</p><p><br> Great tears welled up in His eyes, then spilled to the ground as His whole body began to heave and shudder with intense sorrow and overwhelming fear. He groaned under the unbearable weight of soul-crushing grief; His sweat became drops of blood squeezing through the pores of His skin, falling to earth, mingling with His tears...</p><p>當他的整個身體開始因強烈的悲傷和壓倒性的恐懼而顫抖時，淚水從他的眼睛裡湧了出來，然後灑到地上。 他在壓碎靈魂的難以承受的悲傷下呻吟；他的汗水變成了血滴，從皮膚毛孔中擠出來，落到地上，與他的眼淚混合在一起......</p><p><br> When at last He could speak, He gasped out a prayer to His beloved, faithful Father.</p><p>當他終於能說話時，他向他心愛的、忠實的父親祈禱。</p><p><br> "Abba... Father... You can do anything... please... take this cup away from Me..."</p><p>「阿巴... 父親... 你可以做任何事情......請......把這個杯子從我身邊拿走......」</p><p><br> Sorrow wracked His body for a good long time now, as He poured out His trouble wordlessly to God.</p><p>悲傷使他的身體顫抖了很長一段時間，當他無言地將他的煩惱傾訴給上帝。</p><p><br> When again He was calm enough to speak, Jesus continued.</p><p>當他再次平靜到說話時，耶穌繼續說道。</p><p><br> "Yet not My will..." He struggled to tame His body's natural fear response to the suffering He knew was imminent.</p><p>「但不要做我想做的事......」 他努力馴服身體對他知道迫在眉睫的痛苦的自然恐懼反應。</p><p><br> "But... Yours... be done."</p><p>「做你想做的事。」</p><p><br></p><center>💠</center><p><br><br> Calm again for the moment, Jesus headed back to where His three closest friends were praying...</p><p>耶穌再次冷靜下來，回到他三個最親密的朋友祈禱的地方......</p><p><br> only to discover them all snoring gently.</p><p>但他卻發現他們都在輕輕地打鼾。</p><p><br> He was not surprised -- He understood their weakness -- but tonight was going to be the worst of <u>their</u> lives, too, and they would need the strength that only prayer could bring.</p><p>他並不感到驚訝——他理解他們的弱點——但今晚也將是他們一生中最糟糕的一次，他們需要只有祈禱才能帶來的力量。</p><p><br> "You're sleeping, Simon," He said to Peter, calling him by his old name rather than by the new one He had given him. Peter was anything but a rock at this moment.</p><p>「你在睡覺，西蒙，」他對彼得說，用他的舊名字而不是他給他的新名字來稱呼他。 此刻，彼得一點也不是一塊石頭。</p><p><br> "You couldn't even watch with Me for one hour?"</p><p>「你就不能跟我一起熬夜一個小時嗎？」</p><p><br> Peter stared at Jesus through bleary eyes. He had fallen soundly asleep and had been dreaming of happier times -- of fishing in a boat with Jesus as one of his crew, pulling in a wonderful catch of fish...</p><p>彼得睡眼惺忪地看著耶穌。 他已經熟睡了，一直夢想著更幸福的時光——耶穌是他的船員之一，正在船上釣魚，他們抓到了很多很多大魚......</p><p><br> "Stay awake, and pray, lest you enter into temptation. The spirit is willing and ready, but the flesh is weak."</p><p>「要警醒禱告，免得陷入試探。心靈願意並準備好，但身體卻軟弱。」</p><p><br></p><center>💠</center><p><br><br> Once the three Apostles were awake and praying once again, Jesus headed back to wrestle with His Father yet further.</p><p>當三位使徒醒來並再次祈禱時，耶穌回去花更多時間與他的父親討論。</p><p><br> He needed to know -- for sure -- that there was no other option, because if there were any other way to save the world, He would surely take it!</p><p>他需要知道——當然——沒有其他選擇，因為如果有任何其他方法來拯救世界，他肯定會接受！</p><p><br> Again, tears and groans wracked His body as He laid His case before His Father. Surely there must be some other, less horrific solution to the problem of mankind's sin.</p><p>當他把案子擺在他父親面前時，眼淚和呻吟再次折磨著他的身體。 當然，必須有其他不那麼可怕的解決方案來解決人類的罪惡問題。</p><p><br> But there wasn't.</p><p>但沒有。</p><p><br></p><center>💠</center><p><br><br> When He returned a third time and found His Apostles sleeping yet again, Jesus was calm.</p><p>當他第三次回來時，發現他的使徒們又在睡覺，耶穌很平靜。</p><p><br> He was now resigned to His fate... the plan He and His Father had crafted together... before creating the earth.</p><p>他現在聽天由命了......他和他父親一起制定的計劃......在創造地球之前。</p><p><br> He knew there was no other way... no other solution.</p><p>他知道沒有其他辦法......沒有其他解決方案。</p><p><br> And He loved His Father more than He hated the pain, humiliation, suffering and death filling the cup placed before Him.</p><p>他愛他的父親勝過憎恨擺在他面前的杯子裡的痛苦、羞辱、苦難和死亡。</p><p><br> He would drink it... to the dregs.</p><p>他會喝掉所有的……甚至最後一滴。</p><p><br></p><center>💠</center><p><br><br> "You may as well sleep now." He spoke over the Apostles' peaceful snores.</p><p>「你們現在還不如睡覺。」他對著使徒們和平的鼾子說話。</p><p><br> Then, as a group of men carrying torches and weapons approached, He shook them all awake.</p><p>然後，當一群手持火把和武器的人走近時，他把他們都搖醒了。</p><p><br> "It's time now: the Son of Man is handed over to sinners. Get up! Let's go."</p><p>「現在是時候了：人子被交給罪人。 起來！ 我們走吧。」</p><p><br> "Look! My betrayer is here."</p><p>「快看！背叛我的人就在這裡。」</p><p><br></p><center>💠</center><p><br><br> <em>Based on Matthew 26:36-45.</em></p><p>基於馬太福音26:36-45。</p><p><br></p><center>💠</center></div><span>Tagged with 標記為: </span><ul class="tag-list"><li><a href="/tags/jesus">Jesus</a></li><li><a href="/tags/prayer">prayer</a></li><li><a href="/tags/agony">agony</a></li><li><a href="/tags/gethsemane">Gethsemane</a></li><li><a href="/tags/god">God</a></li><li><a href="/tags/will">will</a></li><li><a href="/tags/surrender">surrender</a></li><li><a href="/tags/peter">Peter</a></li><li><a href="/tags/james">James</a></li><li><a href="/tags/john">John</a></li></ul></article></div><footer class="translate-link"><p>🌐 <a href="https://truth--about--jesus-github-io.translate.goog/?_x_tr_sl=zh-TW&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp">Translate this website with Google</a></p><p>🌐 <a href="https://truth--about--jesus-github-io.translate.goog/?_x_tr_sl=en&_x_tr_tl=zh-TW&_x_tr_hl=zh-TW&_x_tr_pto=wapp">用谷歌翻譯這個網站</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Generated using 使用生成的 Publish</a></p><p><a href="https://opendyslexic.org">English font 英語字型: OpenDyslexic-Alta</a></p><p><a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed 提要</a></p><p style="margin-bottom: 40px;">© 2024-2025 <a href="mailto: truth-about-jesus@proton.me">Enid Ning</a>, in collaboration with Jesus of Nazareth, Son of God, Son of Man, Creator, Sustainer and Ruler of the Universe.</p></footer></body></html>
