And if God is glorified in Him, God will glorify Him in Himself, and will glorify Him immediately."</p><p>「現在，人子得榮耀了，神也在他身上得榮耀了。 如果上帝在他身上榮耀，上帝會在他自己身上榮耀他，並立即榮耀他。」</p><p><br> There was general puzzlement among the Apostles. What was Jesus saying?</p><p>使徒們普遍感到困惑。 耶穌在說什麼？</p><p><br> Being glorified sounded like a good thing, reasoned John. So why did Jesus seem so sad?</p><p>約翰推理道，被榮耀聽起來是件好事。 那麼，為什麼耶穌看起來如此悲傷？</p><p><br> And what about Judas Iscariot? He had escaped!</p><p>加略人猶大呢？ 他逃脫了！</p><p><br> Something had to be done. So why was Jesus doing nothing? He had actually encouraged Judas to leave without alerting the others!</p><p>必須做一些事情。 那麼，為什麼耶穌什麼都不做？ 他實際上鼓勵猶大在不提醒其他人的情況下離開！</p><p><br> John thought a bit more about this.</p><p>約翰對此想得更多一點。</p><p><br> Perhaps Jesus would escape from the Chief Priests as He had escaped from others so many times before.</p><p>也許耶穌會逃離祭司長，就像他以前多次逃離其他人一樣。</p><p><br> But lately He had spoken much of... of things happening that were completely unthinkable. <em>He</em> is the Messiah! Terrible things <em>cannot</em> happen to Him! God gives His Anointed One <em>victory</em> over His enemies!</p><p>但最近他談到了很多……發生的事情，這些事情是完全不可想像的。他是彌賽亞！不會有什麼可怕的事發生在他身上！神讓祂的受膏者戰勝了祂的敵人！</p><p><br></p><center>💠</center><p><br><br> "My children, i am with you for just a little longer; and you will look for Me; and now i say to you what i said to the Jews earlier: where i am going you cannot come."</p><p>「我的孩子們，我和你們在一起還有一會兒；你們會尋找我；現在我對你們說我以前對猶太人說過的話：你不能來我要去的地方。」</p><p><br> <em>What?!</em> Peter couldn't believe it.</p><p>什麼？！ 彼得不敢相信。</p><p><br> He had given up <em>everything</em> to follow Jesus -- home, family, livelihood -- and now Jesus was <em>abandoning</em> them?!</p><p>他為了跟隨耶穌而放棄了一切——家、家庭、生計——現在耶穌拋棄了他們？！</p><p><br> What did Jesus expect him to do? Go back to <em>fishing?!</em></p><p>耶穌期望他做什麼？ 回去釣魚？！</p><p><br> He could never -- not after all he'd been through with Jesus!</p><p>他永遠不可能——畢竟他和耶穌一起經歷了！</p><p><br> He would <em>never</em> let Jesus go.</p><p>他永遠不會讓耶穌走。</p><p><br> <em>Ever.</em></p><p>永遠。</p><p><br></p><center>💠</center><p><br><br> John was beginning to have an inkling that Jesus was walking knowingly and deliberately into a fate greater than Himself -- or the twelve of them.</p><p>約翰開始意識到耶穌正在有意識地、有意地走向比祂自己（或他們十二個人）更偉大的命運。</p><p><br> So he was still able to focus as Jesus continued.</p><p>因此，當耶穌繼續時，他仍然能夠集中注意力。</p><p><br> "A new command i give you: love one another as i have loved you. Everyone will know that you are My followers if you love one another."</p><p>「我給你一個新的命令：彼此相愛，就像我愛你一樣。 如果你們彼此相愛，每個人都會知道你們是我的追隨者。」</p><p><br> Now Peter broke in. He had not heard anything after Jesus had said He was going away, and he could not listen anymore.</p><p>現在彼得打斷了。耶穌說要離開後，他什麼也沒聽到，他再也聽不下去了。</p><p><br> His heart was being torn in two. He had to speak, to end this freakish nightmare.</p><p>他的心被撕成兩分。 他必須說話，才能結束這場怪異的噩夢。</p><p><br> "Lord? Where are You going?"</p><p>「主啊？ 你要去哪裡？」</p><p><br> Jesus looked at him with measureless compassion, knowing that Peter would soon experience even more terrible heartbreak.</p><p>耶穌帶著無比的憐憫看著他，知道彼得很快就會經歷更可怕的心碎。</p><p><br> So He spoke with infinite tenderness.</p><p>所以他以無限的溫柔說話。</p><p><br> "Where i am going, you cannot follow right now, but you will follow in the end."</p><p>「我要去的地方，你現在不能跟隨，但你最終會跟隨。」</p><p><br> This was not acceptable to Peter. He was not willing, after all they'd been through together, to let go of his Lord and Master so easily.</p><p>這對彼得來說是不可接受的。 畢竟他們一起經歷了這一切，他不願意如此輕易地放開他的主和主人。</p><p><br> "My Lord, why can't i follow You now? i am ready to lay down my life for You!"</p><p>「主啊，為什麼我現在不能跟隨您？我已經準備好為您而死了！」</p><p><br> "Are you ready to lay down your life for Me?" Jesus paused, knowing full well how His next words would be received by this impetuous firebrand of an Apostle through whom He fully intended to build something beautiful and magnificent.</p><p>「你準備好為我去死了嗎？」 耶穌停頓了一下，他很清楚這位像火把一樣的使徒會如何接受他接下來的話。他完全打算透過他建造一些美麗而巨集偉的東西。</p><p><br> "I'm telling you the truth: Tonight, before the rooster crows twice, you will say that you don't know Me -- <em>three times!"</em></p><p>“我跟你說實話：今晚，在公雞叫兩次之前，你會說你不認識我——三次！”</p><p><br></p><center>💠</center><p><br><br> Anger and determination rose in Peter's chest.</p><p>憤怒和決心在彼得的胸膛中升起。</p><p><br> Jesus may be a prophet -- yes, even the Son of God! -- but Peter had <em>always</em> conquered through force of will, and tonight would be no different!</p><p>耶穌是一位先知——是的，甚至是上帝的兒子！——但彼得總是透過意志的力量征服，今晚也不例外！</p><p><br> "Even if i have to die with You, i will <em>never</em> deny knowing You, my Lord!" he contended fiercely.</p><p>「即使我必須和你一起死，我永遠不會否認認識你，我的主！」 他激烈地爭辯。</p><p><br> All the other Apostles said the same.</p><p>所有其他使徒都說了同樣的話。</p><p><br></p><center>💠</center><p><br><br> Peter thought quickly. John's whispered revelation as they had followed Jesus out the door and into the night had floored him -- Judas had seemed like such a decent guy... Peter had genuinely liked him...!</p><p>彼得想得很快。 約翰的低聲啟示，當他們跟隨耶穌走出門，進入黑夜時，這讓他感到震驚——猶大看起來像一個體面的人...... 彼得真的很喜歡他......！</p><p><br> Now, he steeled himself to do what must be done. Judas Iscariot must not be permitted to hand Jesus over to the religious leaders.</p><p>現在，他堅定地去做必須做的事情。 他絕不能允許加略人猶大將耶穌交給宗教領袖。</p><p><br> Of late, Jesus had seemed more morose and negative, saying things that seemed to Peter defeatist and unacceptable.</p><p>最近，耶穌似乎更加悶悶不平，說了一些在彼得看來是失敗主義和不可接受的事情。</p><p><br> He felt under his cloak for his sword. As a fisherman, he had never had cause to use such a thing. But now, if Jesus was right about Judas --</p><p>他在斗篷下摸了摸他的劍。 作為一名漁夫，他從來沒有理由使用過這樣的東西。 但現在，如果耶穌對猶大的看法是對的——</p><p><br> he, Peter, was going to have to do it.</p><p>他，彼得，將不得不這樣做。</p><p><br> He would <em>prove</em> -- beyond the shadow of a doubt -- his total devotion to Jesus!</p><p>他將證明他對耶穌的完全忠誠，這樣就沒有人可以再懷疑他了。</p><p><br></p><center>💠</center><p><br><br> <em>Based on John 13:28-38; Mark 14:30-31.</em></p><p>基於約翰福音13:28-38；馬可福音14:30-31。</p><p><br></p><center>💠</center>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://truth-about-jesus.github.io/stories/jesusexample</guid><title>6 - Jesus' example  耶穌的例子</title><description>Jesus explains His actions  耶穌解釋了他的行為</description><link>https://truth-about-jesus.github.io/stories/jesusexample</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 May 2024 09:56:00 -0400</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>None of the remaining Apostles resisted when Jesus came to wash their feet, even though it seemed very strange to them as well.</p><p>當耶穌來給他們洗腳時，剩下的使徒都沒有反抗，儘管這對他們來說也很奇怪。</p><p><br> When He was done, Jesus put on His long cloak again and resumed His place at the table.</p><p>做完後，耶穌再次穿上長斗篷，重新坐在餐桌上。</p><p><br> "Do you understand what i have just done for you?" He looked at them all kindly.</p><p>「你明白我剛才為你做了什麼嗎？」 他和善地看著他們所有人。</p><p><br> The Apostles stared at one another. No one knew quite how to respond to His question.</p><p>使徒們互相盯著對方。 沒有人知道如何回答他的問題。</p><p><br> "You call Me 'Teacher' and 'Lord' -- which is fitting, because that is what i am.</p><p>「你叫我'老師'和'主'——這很合適，因為這就是我。</p><p><br> "If i -- Your Teacher and Lord -- have washed <em>your</em> feet, then <em>you</em> also ought to wash each other's feet."</p><p>「如果我——你的老師和主——洗了你的腳，那麼你們也應該互相洗腳。」</p><p><br> Peter struggled inside with this disturbing statement. It was unsettling enough to let Jesus wash his feet. But... to lower <em>himself</em> like that? How could he, Peter -- the rock on which Jesus had said He would build His church -- wash the feet of his younger brother Andrew, or Simon, or Matthew, who had been a despised tax collector before Jesus had called him?!</p><p>彼得因這令人不安的言論而內心掙扎。讓耶穌洗腳已經夠令人不安的了。但他怎麼能讓自己變得如此卑微呢？他，彼得——他是耶穌曾說過要在其上建造他的教會的磐石——怎麼能為他的弟弟安得烈——或西門——或馬太洗腳？在耶穌呼召馬太之前，他曾經是個受人鄙視的稅吏！</p><p><br> Knowing their inner struggles, Jesus continued patiently.</p><p>知道他們內心的掙扎，耶穌耐心地繼續。</p><p><br> "I have set you this example, so that you may do what i have done for you.</p><p>「我給你樹立了這個榜樣，這樣你就可以做我為你做的事情。</p><p><br> "This is the truth: No servant is greater than his master, and no apostle is greater than the one who sends him."</p><p>「這是事實：沒有僕人比他的主人更偉大，也沒有使徒比派他來的人更偉大。」</p><p><br> Peter could not argue with this logic. If Jesus, whom he loved and greatly admired, washed his feet, he could no longer consider such an activity beneath him, he realized -- no matter what anyone else thought or said.</p><p>彼得無法反駁這種邏輯。 如果他所愛並非常欽佩的耶穌洗了他的腳，他不再能考慮在他下面進行這樣的活動，他意識到——不管其他人怎麼想或說什麼。</p><p><br> "If you know these things, you will be happy if you do them," Jesus concluded with a smile.</p><p>「如果你知道這些事情，如果你做了，你會很高興，」 耶穌微笑著總結道。</p><p><br></p><center>💠</center><p><br><br> "What i have said doesn't apply to all of you," said Jesus unexpectedly, breaking into their moment of silent introspection.</p><p>「我所說的並不適用於你們所有人，」 耶穌出人意料地說，進入了他們沉默的自省時刻。</p><p><br> Everyone raised their heads and stared at Jesus. What could He possibly mean?</p><p>每個人都抬起頭，盯著耶穌。 他可能意味著什麼？</p><p><br> "I know those whom i have chosen. But the Holy Writing must be fulfilled that says, 'The one who shares my food has lifted up his heel against me.'"</p><p>「我認識那些我選擇的人。 但聖經必須完成，聖經說：“分享我食物的人已經抬起腳跟來攻擊我。”」</p><p><br> As the other Apostles puzzled over these cryptic statements, Judas Iscariot slowly raised his eyes to see Jesus looking directly at him.</p><p>當其他使徒對這些神秘的陳述感到困惑時，加略人猶大慢慢地抬起眼睛，看到耶穌直視著他。</p><p><br> He blushed, and he wondered what Jesus was going to do to him, now that it was clear He knew.</p><p>他的臉變紅了，他想知道耶穌要對他做什麼，因為耶穌顯然知道了。</p><p><br> But Jesus didn't do anything. Instead, He continued speaking generally to all at the meal.</p><p>但耶穌什麼都沒做。 相反，他在吃飯時繼續向所有人籠統地說話。</p><p><br> "I'm telling you this before it happens, so that when it happens, you will believe that i am the One."</p><p>「我在它發生之前告訴你這件事，這樣當它發生時，你會相信我就是那個人。」</p><p><br> Judas breathed a momentary sigh of relief.</p><p>猶大暫時鬆了一口氣。</p><p><br> Then Jesus dropped a bombshell:</p><p>然後耶穌扔了一個重磅炸彈：</p><p><br> "I am telling you the truth: one of you will betray Me."</p><p>「我告訴你真相：你們中的一個人會背叛我。」</p><p><br> Beads of sweat were now gathering on Judas' brow. Was his sudden intense discomfort obvious to everyone?</p><p>汗珠現在聚集在猶大的額頭上。 他突如其來的強烈不適對每個人都是顯而易見的嗎？</p><p><br> Then he saw that all the others were looking very sad -- not at him, but at Jesus.</p><p>然後他看到其他人看起來都很悲傷——不是看著他，而是看著耶穌。</p><p><br> Clearly none of them suspected him still!</p><p>顯然，他們都沒有意識到他在做什麼！</p><p><br></p><center>💠</center><p><br><br> Peter was shocked and troubled by Jesus' last statement. <em>Who</em> of them would <em>dare</em> to betray their beloved Lord?!</p><p>彼得對耶穌剛才所說的話感到震驚和困擾。他們誰敢背叛心愛的主？！</p><p><br> He gestured to John who was still, of course, right beside Jesus.</p><p>他向約翰做了個手勢，約翰當然還在耶穌身邊。</p><p><br> Catching Peter's gesture and glance, John knew right away what Peter wanted, because it was what he, too, wanted at that very moment.</p><p>約翰立刻注意到彼得的手勢和眼神，立刻就知道彼得想要什麼，因為這也是他那一刻想要的。</p><p><br> He leaned back toward Jesus and spoke softly in His ear.</p><p>他向後靠向耶穌，在他耳邊輕聲說話。</p><p><br> "Master, who is it?"</p><p>「大師，是誰？」</p><p><br> Jesus spoke very quietly, so only John could hear.</p><p>耶穌說話非常安靜，所以只有約翰能聽到。</p><p><br> "It is the one to whom i will give this bread, after i have dipped it."</p><p>「我把這個麵包沾完之後，就給他。」</p><p><br> He dipped the piece of bread generously in the dipping sauce and handed it -- to Judas Iscariot.</p><p>他慷慨地將那塊麵包浸在蘸醬中，然後遞給加略人猶大。</p><p><br> As he accepted the bread, Judas noticed young John staring directly at him, looking stricken. Instantly he realized that John knew, that Peter would soon know, and that he was no longer welcome among Jesus' chosen Apostles.</p><p>當他接受麵包時，猶大注意到年輕的約翰直視著他，看起來很受點。 他立刻知道約翰知道，彼得很快就會知道，而且他在耶穌所揀選的使徒中不再受歡迎。</p><p><br> He stood up from the table quickly, thinking irrationally only of escape.</p><p>他迅速從桌子上站起來，不理智地只想著逃跑。</p><p><br> All eyes turned to him, and even in his terror, Judas realized the rest of them still did not know -- not even Peter.</p><p>所有的目光都轉向了他，即使在他的恐懼中，猶大也意識到其他人仍然不知道——甚至彼得也不知道。</p><p><br> Jesus spoke directly to Judas now, His eyes filled with great sorrow and profound compassion.</p><p>耶穌現在直接對猶大說話，他的眼睛裡充滿了巨大的悲傷和深深的憐憫。</p><p><br> "What you are about to do, do it quickly."</p><p>「你要做的事，快做。」</p><p><br> Judas lowered his eyes, picked up the moneybag, and got himself out the door as quickly as possible, escaping into the night.</p><p>猶大垂下眼睛，拿起錢袋，儘快走出門，逃到夜裡。</p><p><br></p><center>💠</center><p><br><br> <em>Based on John 13:12-30.</em></p><p>基於約翰福音13:12-30。</p><p><br></p><center>💠</center>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://truth-about-jesus.github.io/stories/dirtyfeet</guid><title>5 - Jesus and the dirty feet  耶穌和髒腳</title><description>Jesus washes His Apostles' feet  耶穌洗了他的使徒的腳</description><link>https://truth-about-jesus.github.io/stories/dirtyfeet</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 May 2024 08:49:00 -0400</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At last! All was ready.</p><p>終於！ 一切都準備好了。</p><p><br> Peter and John rested from their labours, enjoying the scintillating aroma of roast lamb as they surveyed the thirteen place settings at the table, the cups, the wine, the flat bread, and, of course, the roast lamb, along with the dipping sauce their host had so graciously provided.</p><p>彼得和約翰放下手中的工作，休息了一會兒，享受著烤羊肉的香氣。他們審視了餐桌上的十三個餐具，杯子、酒、麵包，當然還有烤羊肉，還有主人慷慨提供的蘸醬。</p><p><br> The blood of the lamb -- the sign that God would pass over their homes and spare their families when He had destroyed all the firstborn of their harsh Egyptian taskmasters -- had already been painted on the doorposts and lintel of the front door by the master of the house, who was graciously allowing Jesus and His twelve chosen Apostles to celebrate the Passover together in this upper room.</p><p>羔羊的血——這是一個跡象，表明上帝在消滅了嚴厲的埃及工頭的所有長子後，將越過他們的家園並饒恕他們的家人——已經被房子的主人畫在前門的門柱和門楣上，他慷慨地允許耶穌和他的十二位被選中的使徒在這個上層房間一起慶祝逾越節。</p><p><br> Now all that remained was for Jesus and the other ten to arrive and celebrate Passover together, as God had ordained so many years ago through Moses, the night He'd freed their people from four hundred years of slavery.</p><p>現在，他們只需要等待耶穌和其他十使徒到來，就可以一起慶祝逾越節了，正如上帝多年前透過摩西所吩咐的那樣，那天晚上他把他們的人民從四百年的奴隸制中解放出來。</p><p><br></p><center>💠</center><p><br><br> Peter looked at John, who looked away. All of the disciples were avoiding each other's eyes as the realization came: the master of the house had neglected to provide any servant to wash their dusty, dirty feet!</p><p>彼得看著約翰，約翰把目光移開。 當人們意識到時，所有的門徒都在躲避對方的眼睛：房子的主人忽略了提供任何僕人來洗他們塵土飛揚的髒腳！</p><p><br> They were all at table, almost ready to begin. Jesus, with John beside Him -- as the youngest, John was always right next to Jesus -- Matthew, Bartholomew, Thomas, Judas Iscariot, Peter, James, Andrew, Thaddeus, Simon, Philip and the other James, the son of Alphaeus.</p><p>他們都坐到了餐桌旁，幾乎準備開始了。耶穌，約翰在他身邊──身為最年輕的使徒，約翰總是在耶穌旁邊──馬太、巴多羅買、多馬、加略人猶大、彼得、雅各、安得烈、達太、西門、腓力和亞勒腓的兒子雅各。</p><p><br> They had grown accustomed to the VIP treatment meted out to them as Jesus' celebrity had increased exponentially.</p><p>隨著耶穌的名人呈指數級增長，他們已經習慣了對他們的貴賓待遇。</p><p><br> Now, all were in a quandary.</p><p>現在，所有的使徒都不知道該怎麼辦了。</p><p><br> <em>If I do it, I'll be lowering myself,</em> thought Peter, looking meaningfully at John, whom he liked to consider his deputy.</p><p>如果我這樣做，我會降低自己，彼得想，有意義地看著約翰，他喜歡把他當作他的副手。</p><p><br> John avoided Peter's eyes. <em>He isn't going to rope me into doing the servant's job! Not this time!</em> he thought, steeling himself to withstand Peter's naturally overbearing personality.</p><p>約翰避開了彼得的眼睛。 他不會騙我去做僕人的工作！這次不行！ 他想，為了抵擋彼得天生的霸道性格而強行。</p><p><br> The other disciples looked at each other uncomfortably. Judas Iscariot had already made up his mind not to involve himself in the petty quarrels in which the others sometimes engaged. He had higher matters to consider -- like determining exactly when would be the best time to hand Jesus over to the Chief Priests... and truly earn that bag of Tyrian shekels that were burning a hole in his pocket.</p><p>其他門徒不舒服地看著對方。 加略人猶大已經下定決心不捲入其他人有時捲入的小爭吵中。 他有更高的考慮事項要考慮——比如確切地確定何時是將耶穌交給祭司長的最佳時機......並真正賺取那袋在他的口袋裡燒了一個洞的提謝克爾。</p><p><br> After enduring several moments of silent jockeying for position among His chosen Apostles, Jesus sighed.</p><p>在忍受了幾次默默地爭奪他選擇的使徒中的位置後，耶穌嘆了口氣。</p><p><br> He'd known in advance what He was going to do. His Father had made it clear. But the obvious rivalry between His closest friends and followers told Him they all still had a long way to go.</p><p>他事先知道他要做什麼。 他的父親已經說清楚了。 但他最親密的朋友和追隨者之間的明顯競爭告訴他，他們還有很長的路要走。</p><p><br> He stood up.</p><p>他站起來了。</p><p><br> All eyes turned to Him rather guiltily, as if expecting Him to now clarify which of them was the low man on the apostolic totem pole. Every man breathed a silent prayer in his heart that Jesus would not ask him to "do the honours"...</p><p>所有的目光都相當內疚地轉向他，彷彿期待他現在澄清他們中誰是使徒圖騰柱上的低等人。每個人都在心裡默默地祈禱，祈求耶穌不要要求他「做僕人」…</p><p><br></p><center>💠</center><p><br><br> When Jesus got to Peter, Peter roused himself from his dumbfounded reverie.</p><p>當耶穌來到彼得身邊時，彼得從他目瞪口呆的遐想中振作起來。</p><p><br> "Lord? Are <em>You</em> going to wash <em>my</em> feet?!"</p><p>「主啊？你要給我洗腳嗎？！」</p><p><br> They had all been stunned... and silent... but Peter's question awoke them from their own bewildered trances.</p><p>他們都驚呆了......沉默了......但彼得的問題把他們從自己困惑的恍惚中喚醒。</p><p><br> Jesus had taken off His big cloak, tied a towel around His waist, taken a large basin of clean water, and proceeded to "do the honours" Himself, as if He were nothing more than a common household slave!</p><p>耶穌脫下他的大斗篷，把毛巾綁在腰上，拿了一大盆乾淨的水，然後自己「做僕人」，好像他只不過是一個普通的家庭奴隸！</p><p><br> Going around to each of the Apostles in turn, He knelt down, placed their feet in the water-filled basin, and washed off all the dirt, dust and grime with His own hands. He then towelled the clean feet dry using the towel around His waist.</p><p>他依次走到每個使徒身邊，跪下，把他們的腳放在裝滿水的盆子裡，用自己的雙手洗掉所有的汙垢、灰塵和汙垢。 然後他用腰間的毛巾擦乾他們乾淨的腳。</p><p><br> As usual, Peter had been the first to find his words.</p><p>像往常一樣，彼得是第一個找到他的話的人。</p><p><br></p><center>💠</center><p><br><br> "You do not know what I am doing now," responded Jesus gently, "but afterwards, you will know."</p><p>「你不知道我現在在做什麼，」 耶穌溫和地回答， 「但之後，你會知道的。」</p><p><br> Indignation rose in Peter at His beloved Lord and Master's total humiliation in taking on a servant's role. It was unthinkable!</p><p>彼得對他心愛的主和主人在扮演僕人的角色時完全羞辱而感到憤慨。 這是不可想象的！</p><p><br> <em>"No!"</em> He spoke decisively and more loudly than he had intended. He didn't understand why, but something about Jesus' willingness to lower Himself in this way frightened him. It seemed unnatural...</p><p>「不！」 他說話果斷，聲音比他預期的要大。 他不明白為什麼，但耶穌願意以這種方式降低自己，這讓他感到害怕。 這似乎不自然......</p><p><br> He pulled his feet away.</p><p>他把腳拉開了。</p><p><br> "You shall <em>never</em> wash my feet!"</p><p>「你永遠不會洗我的腳！」</p><p><br> Jesus looked at Peter kindly. He had expected some pushback from His most outspoken, impulsive follower.

A little abashed, he buried his face in the rough folds of the nice man's clothing, feeling almost safer than he did with Mommy.</p><p>大漢們盯著以撒，再次皺了皺眉頭。 他感到害羞，把臉埋在好人衣服粗糙的褶皺裡。 他感覺幾乎比和母親在一起更安全。</p><p><br></p><center>💠</center><p><br><br> “Whoever receives one child like this in My Name, receives Me.”</p><p>「凡以我的名接待這樣一個孩子的人，就是接待了我。」</p><p><br> “And whoever causes one of these little ones believing in Me to stumble, it would be better for him to have a heavy millstone hung around his neck, and be submerged in the depths of the sea.”</p><p>「無論誰讓這些相信我的小孩子跌倒，對他來說，最好在他的脖子上掛上一塊沉重的磨石，並浸入海底深處。」</p><p><br> This made Isaac shiver a little and snuggle in deeper.</p><p>這讓以撒有點顫抖，依偎得更深。</p><p><br> “Woe to the world because of stumbling blocks!

He looked down.</p><p>「我們正在爭論誰更偉大，耶穌，」他平靜地承認。 他低下頭。</p><p><br> Jesus caught his eye and smiled, and John immediately felt better.</p><p>耶穌看著他微笑，約翰立刻感覺好多了。</p><p><br></p><center>💠</center><p><br><br> The other disciples began to chime in slowly.</p><p>其他弟子也開始慢慢附和。</p><p><br> “Yeah.”</p><p>「是的。」</p><p><br> “We didn't know, Lord.”</p><p>「我們不知道，主。」</p><p><br></p><center>💠</center><p><br><br> One of the men caught Hoppy and picked him up gently. He brought the little frog back to Isaac, squatting down to offer him to the boy at his level.</p><p>其中一名男子抓住料斗，輕輕把他抱了起來。 他把小青蛙抱回以撒身邊，跪下，將他交給男孩。</p><p><br> “Here ya go, little guy!”</p><p>「來了，小傢伙！」</p><p><br> As Isaac accepted his beloved pet gratefully, the man tousled Isaac's hair and gave him a cheerful grin.</p><p>當以撒感激地接受了他心愛的寵物時，那個男人撥亂了以撒的頭髮，給了他一個愉快的笑容。</p><p><br> A wide smile lit up Isaac's face. The atmosphere had changed, and he found himself suddenly quite at ease with the kindly, laughing guests.</p><p>以撒的臉上綻放出燦爛的笑容。 氣氛變了，他發現自己突然對那些和善、歡笑的客人感到很自在。</p><p><br></p><center>💠</center><p><br><br> <em>Based on Mark 9:33-37.</em></p><p>基於馬可福音 9:33-37。</p><p><br></p><center>💠</center>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://truth-about-jesus.github.io/stories/vip</guid><title>1 - Jesus and the Very Important Person  耶穌和非常重要的人</title><description>People ask Jesus for help  人們向耶穌尋求幫助</description><link>https://truth-about-jesus.github.io/stories/vip</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Mar 2024 08:24:00 -0400</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When Jesus was extremely popular, every time He showed up anywhere in Galilee, huge crowds of people immediately formed around Him, following Him and wanting to be close to Him.</p><p>當耶穌非常受歡迎時，每次他出現在加利利的任何地方，他周圍都會立即形成一大群人，跟隨他，並想接近他。</p><p><br></p><center>💠</center><p><br><br> One day, a Very Important Person -- the synagogue leader -- with an Extremely Urgent Problem -- his twelve-year-old daughter was dying -- came to Jesus and asked Him to come to his house and touch her, so that she would be healed.</p><p>有一天，一個非常重要的人——猶太教堂的領袖——有一個極其緊急的問題——他十二歲的女兒快死了——來到耶穌身邊，請他來他家摸她，這樣她就會痊癒。</p><p><br></p><center>💠</center><p><br><br> Meanwhile, at the same time, a very <em>un</em>important person -- with no position or title or role, in the synagogue or anywhere else --</p><p>與此同時，一個非常不重要的人——在猶太教堂或其他任何地方沒有職位、頭銜或角色——</p><p><br> who had suffered from nonstop bleeding for twelve years,</p><p>她連續流血了十二年，</p><p><br> heard that Jesus was passing through (on His way to the synagogue leader's house).</p><p>她聽說耶穌經過（在去會堂負責人家的路上）。</p><p><br> She (the very unimportant person) had spent all her money on doctors, who had tried all sorts of procedures to stop her bleeding.
