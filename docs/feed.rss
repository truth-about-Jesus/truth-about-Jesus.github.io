His mother Mary was a virgin when He was conceived through the Holy Spirit. His foster father was Joseph. He had brothers and sisters.</p><p>耶穌也出生在一個親生家庭。 當他透過聖靈受孕時，他的母親瑪麗是處女。 他的養父是約瑟夫。 他有兄弟姐妹。</p><p><br></p><h5><em>Luke 1:30-35,37 (NET)</em></h5><h6><br></h6><p>30 So the angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God!</p><p>31 Listen: You will become pregnant and give birth to a son, and you will name him Jesus.</p><p>32 He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give him the throne of his father David.</p><p>33 He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and his kingdom will never end.”</p><p>34 Mary said to the angel, “How will this be, since I have not been intimate with a man?”</p><p>35 The angel replied, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. Therefore the child to be born will be holy; he will be called the Son of God.</p><p>37 For nothing will be impossible with God.”</p><p><br></p><h5><em>Luke 1:30-35,37 (Chinese NET (T))</em></h5><h6><br></h6><p>30 天使對她說：「馬利亞！不要怕；你在 神面前已經蒙恩了。</p><p>31 聽着：你要懷孕生子，你要給他起名叫耶穌。</p><p>32 他要為大，稱為至高者的兒子；主 神要把他祖大衛的位給他；</p><p>33 他要作雅各家的王，直到永遠，他的國也沒有窮盡。」</p><p>34 馬利亞對天使說：「這怎麼可能呢，我還沒有出嫁？」</p><p>35 天使回答說：「聖靈要臨到你身上，至高者的能力要蔭庇你。因此所要生的兒子必為聖，稱為 神的兒子。</p><p>37 因為在 神無所不能。」</p><p><br></p><h5><em>Matthew 1:18-25 (NET)</em></h5><h6><br></h6><p>18 Now the birth of Jesus Christ happened this way. While his mother Mary was engaged to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be pregnant through the Holy Spirit.</p><p>19 Because Joseph, her husband to be, was a righteous man, and because he did not want to disgrace her, he intended to divorce her privately.</p><p>20 When he had contemplated this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, because the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.</p><p>21 She will give birth to a son and you will name him Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.”</p><p>22 This all happened so that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet would be fulfilled:</p><p>23 “Look! The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will name him Emmanuel,” which means “God with us.”</p><p>24 When Joseph awoke from sleep he did what the angel of the Lord told him. He took his wife,</p><p>25 but did not have marital relations with her until she gave birth to a son, whom he named Jesus.</p><p><br></p><h5><em>Matthew 1:18-25 (Chinese NET (T))</em></h5><h6><br></h6><p>18 耶穌基督降生的事記在下面：他母親馬利亞已經和約瑟訂了婚，還沒有成婚，馬利亞就從聖靈懷了孕。</p><p>19 她的未婚夫約瑟是個義人，不願公開的令她難堪，想暗中和她解除婚約。</p><p>20 正思念這事的時候，有主的一位天使在夢中向他顯現，說：「大衛的子孫約瑟，不要怕，只管娶馬利亞為妻，因她所懷的孕是從聖靈來的。</p><p>21 她將要生一個兒子，你要給他起名叫耶穌，因他要將自己的百姓從他們的罪惡裏救出來。」</p><p>22 這一切的事成就，是要應驗主藉先知所說的話：</p><p>23 「必有童貞女懷孕生子，人要稱他的名為以馬內利。」就是「 神與我們同在」的意思。</p><p>24 約瑟醒了，起來，就遵着主天使的吩咐，把妻子娶過來；</p><p>25 只是沒有和她同房，等她生了兒子，就給他起名叫耶穌。</p><p><br></p><h5><em>Matthew 13:54-56 (NET)</em></h5><h6><br></h6><p>54 Then he came to his hometown and began to teach the people in their synagogue. They were astonished and said, “Where did this man get such wisdom and miraculous powers?</p><p>55 Isn’t this the carpenter’s son? Isn’t his mother named Mary? And aren’t his brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?</p><p>56 And aren’t all his sisters here with us? So where did he get all this?”</p><p><br></p><h5><em>Matthew 13:54-56 (Chinese NET (T))</em></h5><h6><br></h6><p>54 回到家鄉，在會堂裏教導人。他們都希奇，說：「這人從那裏有這種智慧和異能呢？</p><p>55 這不是木匠的兒子嗎？他母親不是叫馬利亞嗎？他弟弟們不是叫雅各、約瑟、西門和猶大嗎？</p><p>56 他妹妹們不是都和我們在這裏嗎？他從那裏得到這一切呢？」</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br><br> Once when Jesus was young growing up in the small town of Nazareth, He gave His parents a fright on a trip to the city of Jerusalem.</p><p>有一次，當耶穌在拿撒勒小鎮長大時，他在耶路撒冷城旅行時嚇唬他的父母。</p><p><br></p><h5><em>Luke 2:41-52 (NET)</em></h5><h6><br></h6><p>41 Now Jesus’ parents went to Jerusalem every year for the Feast of the Passover.</p><p>42 When he was twelve years old, they went up according to custom.</p><p>43 But when the feast was over, as they were returning home, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. His parents did not know it,</p><p>44 but (because they assumed that he was in their group of travelers) they went a day’s journey. Then they began to look for him among their relatives and acquaintances.</p><p>45 When they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem to look for him.</p><p>46 After three days they found him in the temple courts, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions.</p><p>47 And all who heard Jesus were astonished at his understanding and his answers.</p><p>48 When his parents saw him, they were overwhelmed. His mother said to him, “Child, why have you treated us like this? Look, your father and I have been looking for you anxiously.”</p><p>49 But he replied, “Why were you looking for me? Didn’t you know that I must be in my Father’s house?”</p><p>50 Yet his parents did not understand the remark he made to them.</p><p>51 Then he went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was obedient to them. But his mother kept all these things in her heart.</p><p>52 And Jesus increased in wisdom and in stature, and in favor with God and with people.</p><p><br></p><h5><em>Luke 2:41-52 (Chinese NET (T))</em></h5><h6><br></h6><p>41 每年到逾越節，耶穌的父母就上耶路撒冷去。</p><p>42 當他十二歲的時候，他們按着慣例上去過節。</p><p>43 守滿了節期，回去的時候，孩童耶穌留在耶路撒冷，他的父母並不知道，</p><p>44 以為他在同行的人中間，走了一天的路程後，就在親族和熟識的人中找他。</p><p>45 既找不着，就回耶路撒冷去找他。</p><p>46 過了三天，就在殿院裏找到他，坐在教師中間，一面聽，一面問。</p><p>47 凡聽見他的，都驚訝他的聰明和他的應對。</p><p>48 當他父母看見了他，就很激動。母親對他說：「我兒，為甚麼這樣對待我們呢？你看，你父親和我十分擔心的來找你。」</p><p>49 耶穌說：「你們為甚麼找我呢？豈不知我應當在我父的家裏嗎？」</p><p>50 他所說的這話，他們卻不明白。</p><p>51 然後他就同他們下去，回到拿撒勒，並且順從他們。他母親卻把這一切的事都存在心裏。</p><p>52 耶穌的智慧和身量，並 神和人喜愛他的心，都一齊增長。</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br><br> Even when He was grown up, He respected His mother's wishes.</p><p>即使在他長大後，他也尊重他母親的願望。</p><p><br></p><h5><em>John 2:1-12 (NET)</em></h5><h6><br></h6><p>1 Now on the third day there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee. Jesus’ mother was there,</p><p>2 and Jesus and his disciples were also invited to the wedding.</p><p>3 When the wine ran out, Jesus’ mother said to him, “They have no wine left.”</p><p>4 Jesus replied, “Woman, why are you saying this to me? My time has not yet come.”</p><p>5 His mother told the servants, “Whatever he tells you, do it.”</p><p>6 Now there were six stone water jars there for Jewish ceremonial washing, each holding twenty or thirty gallons.</p><p>7 Jesus told the servants, “Fill the water jars with water.” So they filled them up to the very top.</p><p>8 Then he told them, “Now draw some out and take it to the head steward,” and they did.</p><p>9 When the head steward tasted the water that had been turned to wine, not knowing where it came from (though the servants who had drawn the water knew), he called the bridegroom</p><p>10 and said to him, “Everyone serves the good wine first, and then the cheaper wine when the guests are drunk. You have kept the good wine until now!”</p><p>11 Jesus did this as the first of his miraculous signs, in Cana of Galilee. In this way he revealed his glory, and his disciples believed in him.</p><p>12 After this he went down to Capernaum with his mother and brothers and his disciples, and they stayed there a few days.</p><p><br></p><h5><em>John 2:1-12 (Chinese NET (T))</em></h5><h6><br></h6><p>1 到了第三日，在加利利的迦拿有一個婚宴。耶穌的母親在那裏，</p><p>2 耶穌和門徒也被請去赴宴。</p><p>3 酒用盡了，耶穌的母親對他說：「他們沒有酒了。」</p><p>4 耶穌說：「婦人！你為甚麼對我說這話呢？我的時候還沒有到。」</p><p>5 他母親對用人說：「他叫你們做甚麼，你們就做甚麼。」</p><p>6 照猶太人潔淨的規矩，有六口石缸擺在那裏，每口可以盛兩三桶水。</p><p>7 耶穌對用人說：「把缸倒滿了水。」他們就倒滿了，直到缸口。</p><p>8 耶穌又說：「現在可以舀出來，送給筵席總管。」他們就送了去。</p><p>9 筵席總管嘗了那用水變的酒，並不知道是那裏來的（雖然舀水的用人知道），便叫新郎來，</p><p>10 對他說：「人家總是先擺上好酒，等客人喝夠了，才擺上較次的；你卻把好酒留到現在！」</p><p>11 這是耶穌所行的第一件神蹟，是在加利利的迦拿行的，顯出了他的榮耀，他的門徒就信他了。</p><p>12 這事以後，耶穌與他的母親、弟兄和門徒一起下迦百農去，在那裏住了幾日。</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br><br> Jesus' biological family didn't always support Him.<br><br>耶穌的親生家庭並不總是支援他。</p><p><br></p><h5><em>Mark 3:20-21 (NET)</em></h5><h6><br></h6><p>20 Now Jesus went home, and a crowd gathered so that they were not able to eat.</p><p>21 When his family heard this they went out to restrain him, for they said, “He is out of his mind.”</p><p><br></p><h5><em>Mark 3:20-21 (Chinese NET (T))</em></h5><h6><br></h6><p>20 耶穌回家，眾人又聚到那裏，叫他們連飯也顧不得吃。</p><p>21 當耶穌的家人聽見這話，就出來要拉住他，因為他們說他瘋了。</p><p><br><br> When they came to the house and called for Him to come out, He didn't go.
