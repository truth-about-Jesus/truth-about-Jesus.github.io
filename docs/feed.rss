He needed the Sanhedrin -- the Jewish ruling council -- fully behind him. And he could not bring this kind of insubstantial evidence before the Roman governor, Pontius Pilate, whose permission would be required before the Jews could put a man to death.</p><p>那年擔任大祭司的該亞法嘆了口氣。 他需要猶太統治委員會完全支援他。 他不能將這種非實質性的證據帶到羅馬總督本丟·彼拉多面前，在猶太人處死一個人之前，需要彼拉多的許可。</p><p><br> In <em>fact,</em> thought Caiaphas, it would be <em>quite</em> the coup to get Pilate <em>himself</em> to execute Jesus -- <em>publicly</em> -- through the most horrendous means: a Roman crucifixion.</p><p>事實上，該亞法認為，讓彼拉多自己透過最可怕的手段公開處決耶穌——這將是一場政變：羅馬釘十字架。</p><p><br> That would send a strong message to any other false messiahs who dared endanger Caiaphas' delicate compact with Rome.</p><p>這將向任何其他敢於危及該亞法與羅馬微妙契約的虛假彌賽亞發出強烈的資訊。</p><p><br></p><center>💠</center><p><br><br> Meanwhile, Peter was realizing with dismay that the folks with whom he sat warming his hands around the fire, were none other than members of the very armed band he had only recently attempted to attack in the garden of Gethsemane.</p><p>與此同時，彼得沮喪地意識到，與他坐在一起的火堆周圍溫暖雙手的人，正是他最近才試圖在客西馬尼花園襲擊的武裝樂隊的成員。</p><p><br> Feeling exposed, he headed away toward the porch, hoping to escape recognition and possible arrest.</p><p>他感到暴露，向門廊走去，希望逃避認可和可能的逮捕。</p><p><br> He immediately regretted this move as, the moment he joined the group on the porch, the eyes of one of the servants there widened in recognition.</p><p>他立刻就後悔了這個舉動，因為他一加入到門廊上的人群中，那裡的一個僕人就認出了他。</p><p><br> <em>"He</em> was with Jesus of Nazareth!" she gasped, pointing directly at Peter, who tried desperately to avoid her finger.</p><p>「他是和拿撒勒人耶穌在一起的！」她喘著氣，指著彼得，彼得拼命想避開她的手指。</p><p><br> "What are you talking about?!" he responded roughly. "By God, i don't know the fellow!"</p><p>「你在說什麼？！」他粗魯地回答。 「天哪，我不認識這個人！」</p><p><br> He added several more oaths for emphasis.</p><p>他又加了幾條誓言來強調。</p><p><br> Intimidated by Peter's fierce anger, the servant apologized profusely, and Peter decided to stay on the porch and join in the conversation, trusting that he had convinced at least <em>this</em> group of his complete and utter detachment from the prisoner.</p><p>僕人被彼得的強烈憤怒所壓倒，連連道歉，彼得決定留在門廊上加入談話，相信他至少讓大家相信他與囚犯完全沒有關係。</p><p><br></p><center>💠</center><p><br><br> Caiaphas sighed.</p><p>該亞法嘆了口氣。</p><p><br> The final two witnesses were botching what had happened in the Temple courtyard just a few days ago, when the young rabbi had made the outlandish claim that He could rebuild the Temple -- which had taken forty-six years to build -- in just three days.</p><p>最後兩個目擊者混淆了幾天前在聖殿院子裡發生的事情，當時年輕的拉比奇怪地聲稱他可以在三天內重建聖殿——但建造聖殿卻花了四十六年！</p><p><br> Even <em>their</em> testimony did not agree.</p><p>甚至他們的證詞也不一致。</p><p><br> He sighed again, realizing he would have to use his authority as Chief Priest to induce the prisoner to blaspheme -- before the Council.</p><p>他再次嘆了口氣，意識到他必須利用他作為首席牧師的權威來誘使囚犯在安理會面前亵渎神明。</p><p><br> And Pilate -- Rome's representative in the region -- would have to be convinced not with satisfactory evidence, but with the threat of a riot.</p><p>彼拉多——羅馬在該地區的代表——必須被說服處決耶穌，不是用令人滿意的證據，而是用騷亂的威脅。</p><p><br> It was messy -- not neat and tidy, the way Caiaphas preferred to do things.</p><p>很亂。該亞法喜歡以乾淨整齊的方式做事。</p><p><br> But it had to be done.</p><p>但它必須完成。</p><p><br></p><center>💠</center><p><br><br> "You <em>must</em> be one of them."</p><p>「你一定是他們中的一員。」</p><p><br> Peter paused mid-sentence, staring at the man who had just spoken, a stranger to him.</p><p>彼得在句子中停頓了一下，盯著剛才說話的人，他是個陌生人。</p><p><br> "Your accent shows it. <em>You're</em> from Galilee, too, like Him!"</p><p>「你的口音表明了這一點。 你也來自加利利，就像他一樣！」</p><p><br> Terrified, Peter began to curse and swear and bluster, desperately trying to convince those around him that he had never known -- let alone followed -- His beloved Lord and Master.</p><p>彼得嚇得開始咒罵和咆哮，拼命地試圖說服他周圍的人，他從未知道——更不用說跟隨——他心愛的主和主人了。</p><p><br> At that moment, a rooster crowed.</p><p>那一刻，一隻公雞叫著。</p><p><br></p><center>💠</center><p><br><br> "What are these men saying about You?"</p><p>「這些人在說你什麼？」</p><p><br> The Chief Priest stood facing Jesus now.</p><p>大祭司現在站在耶穌面前。</p><p><br> "Do You still have no response?!"</p><p>「你仍然沒有迴應嗎？！」</p><p><br> The prisoner looked up calmly and said nothing.</p><p>囚犯平靜地抬起頭，什麼也沒說。</p><p><br> Exasperated, Caiaphas drew himself up to his full stature and, invoking his authority as Chief Priest, said commandingly:</p><p>該亞法勃然大怒，站直身子，引用他作為大祭司的權威，命令道：</p><p><br> "I adjure You, by the Living God, tell us if You are the Messiah -- the Son of God!"</p><p>「我以永生神告你，告訴我們你是否是彌賽亞——上帝的兒子！」</p><p><br> Jesus looked up at him with eyes of fire.</p><p>耶穌用火眼看著他。</p><p><br> "You have said it! I say to you, from now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power, and coming on the clouds of Heaven!"</p><p>「你已經說過了！ 我告訴你們，從現在開始，你們將看到人子坐在權力的右邊，在天堂的雲彩上降臨！」</p><p><br></p><center>💠</center><p><br><br> No longer caring what anyone thought of him, Peter fled through the gate as quickly as he could, his heart crushed as he realized he had unwittingly fulfilled Jesus' prediction that he, Peter -- the <em>rock!</em> -- would deny knowing His beloved Lord <em>three times</em> that very night...</p><p>彼得不再關心任何人對他的看法，他儘快逃進大門，當他意識到他無意中實現了耶穌的預言時，他的心碎了，即他，彼得——磐石！——會否認那天晚上三次認識他心愛的主......</p><p><br></p><center>💠</center><p><br><br> Caiaphas was elated. He had succeeded beyond his wildest dreams in getting the prisoner to incriminate himself before the Sanhedrin.</p><p>該亞法很高興。他成功地讓囚犯在猶太統治委員會面前自證其罪，這超出了他最瘋狂的夢想。</p><p><br> Nevertheless, he put on his most horrified expression and tore his robes in pretended grief and outrage.</p><p>但他還是擺出最驚恐的表情，假裝悲傷和憤怒，撕破了長袍。</p><p><br> <em>"Blasphemy!"</em> he bellowed.</p><p>「亵渎！」 他吼道。</p><p><br> "Can there be any further question? What do you all say?"</p><p>「怎麼會有問題？你怎麼決定？」</p><p><br> All of those present had leapt to their feet, inflamed beyond reason by Jesus' bold, shameless statement.</p><p>所有在場的人都跳了起來，被耶穌大膽、無恥的宣告激怒了。</p><p><br> "He deserves to die!" they thundered as one.</p><p>「他應該死！」 他們像一個一樣打雷。</p><p><br> Then the enraged elders rushed upon the execrable blasphemer, mocking, spitting, slapping and punching</p><p>然後憤怒的長老們衝向這個可惡的褻瀆者，嘲笑、吐口水、掌摑、拳打腳踢</p><p><br> the holy, all-powerful Son of God --</p><p>神聖、全能的神的兒子——</p><p><br> as Caiaphas looked on with glee.</p><p>該亞法高興地看著。</p><p><br></p><center>💠</center><p><br><br> Outside...</p><p>外部...</p><p><br> in the darkened street...</p><p>在漆黑的街道上…</p><p><br> Peter wept bitterly.</p><p>彼得痛哭起來。</p><p><br></p><center>💠</center><p><br><br> <em>Based on Matthew 26:59-75; Mark 14:55-72; John 18:15-27.</em></p><p>基於馬太福音26:59-75；馬可福音14:55-72；約翰福音18:15-27。</p><p><br></p><center>💠</center>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://truth-about-jesus.github.io/stories/arrest</guid><title>10 - Arrest  逮捕</title><description>Jesus surrenders to the authorities  耶穌向當局投降</description><link>https://truth-about-jesus.github.io/stories/arrest</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jun 2024 08:23:00 -0400</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Once all the Apostles were safely away, Jesus held out His hands in a gesture of surrender.</p><p>一旦所有使徒都安全離開，耶穌就伸出雙手投降。</p><p><br> The captain of the armed band, understanding, motioned to the one carrying the rope meant to secure the prisoner.</p><p>武裝樂隊的隊長理解了，向拿著用來捆綁囚犯的繩子的人示意。</p><p><br> The young soldier advanced cautiously and, finding that the young rabbi no longer resisted, succeeded in binding His hands together.</p><p>年輕的士兵小心翼翼地前進，發現年輕的拉比不再反抗，成功地將他的雙手綁在一起。</p><p><br> The whole group relaxed a little and prepared to move out.</p><p>整個小組都放鬆了一點，準備搬出去。</p><p><br></p><center>💠</center><p><br><br> When they arrived at the court of the Chief Priest, Malchus went to wash the blood off his face in the servants' quarters before returning to find out what would happen to the powerful young rabbi who had healed <em>him</em> -- the enemy.</p><p>當他們到達首席牧師的宮廷時，馬爾丘斯去僕人宿舍洗臉上的血，然後回來瞭解治癒他的有權勢的年輕拉比會發生什麼——敵人。</p><p><br> The other servants exclaimed in surprise at his bloody face.</p><p>其他僕人對他血淋淋的臉大吃一驚。</p><p><br> "What happened?

It was unsettling enough to let Jesus wash his feet. But... to lower <em>himself</em> like that? How could he, Peter -- the rock on which Jesus had said He would build His church -- wash the feet of his younger brother Andrew, or Simon, or Matthew, who had been a despised tax collector before Jesus had called him?!</p><p>彼得因這令人不安的言論而內心掙扎。讓耶穌洗腳已經夠令人不安的了。但他怎麼能讓自己變得如此卑微呢？他，彼得——他是耶穌曾說過要在其上建造他的教會的磐石——怎麼能為他的弟弟安得烈——或西門——或馬太洗腳？在耶穌呼召馬太之前，他曾經是個受人鄙視的稅吏！</p><p><br> Knowing their inner struggles, Jesus continued patiently.</p><p>知道他們內心的掙扎，耶穌耐心地繼續。</p><p><br> "I have set you this example, so that you may do what i have done for you.</p><p>「我給你樹立了這個榜樣，這樣你就可以做我為你做的事情。</p><p><br> "This is the truth: No servant is greater than his master, and no apostle is greater than the one who sends him."</p><p>「這是事實：沒有僕人比他的主人更偉大，也沒有使徒比派他來的人更偉大。」</p><p><br> Peter could not argue with this logic. If Jesus, whom he loved and greatly admired, washed his feet, he could no longer consider such an activity beneath him, he realized -- no matter what anyone else thought or said.</p><p>彼得無法反駁這種邏輯。 如果他所愛並非常欽佩的耶穌洗了他的腳，他不再能考慮在他下面進行這樣的活動，他意識到——不管其他人怎麼想或說什麼。</p><p><br> "If you know these things, you will be happy if you do them," Jesus concluded with a smile.</p><p>「如果你知道這些事情，如果你做了，你會很高興，」 耶穌微笑著總結道。</p><p><br></p><center>💠</center><p><br><br> "What i have said doesn't apply to all of you," said Jesus unexpectedly, breaking into their moment of silent introspection.</p><p>「我所說的並不適用於你們所有人，」 耶穌出人意料地說，進入了他們沉默的自省時刻。</p><p><br> Everyone raised their heads and stared at Jesus.

All was ready.</p><p>終於！ 一切都準備好了。</p><p><br> Peter and John rested from their labours, enjoying the scintillating aroma of roast lamb as they surveyed the thirteen place settings at the table, the cups, the wine, the flat bread, and, of course, the roast lamb, along with the dipping sauce their host had so graciously provided.</p><p>彼得和約翰放下手中的工作，休息了一會兒，享受著烤羊肉的香氣。他們審視了餐桌上的十三個餐具，杯子、酒、麵包，當然還有烤羊肉，還有主人慷慨提供的蘸醬。</p><p><br> The blood of the lamb -- the sign that God would pass over their homes and spare their families when He had destroyed all the firstborn of their harsh Egyptian taskmasters -- had already been painted on the doorposts and lintel of the front door by the master of the house, who was graciously allowing Jesus and His twelve chosen Apostles to celebrate the Passover together in this upper room.</p><p>羔羊的血——這是一個跡象，表明上帝在消滅了嚴厲的埃及工頭的所有長子後，將越過他們的家園並饒恕他們的家人——已經被房子的主人畫在前門的門柱和門楣上，他慷慨地允許耶穌和他的十二位被選中的使徒在這個上層房間一起慶祝逾越節。</p><p><br> Now all that remained was for Jesus and the other ten to arrive and celebrate Passover together, as God had ordained so many years ago through Moses, the night He'd freed their people from four hundred years of slavery.</p><p>現在，他們只需要等待耶穌和其他十使徒到來，就可以一起慶祝逾越節了，正如上帝多年前透過摩西所吩咐的那樣，那天晚上他把他們的人民從四百年的奴隸制中解放出來。</p><p><br></p><center>💠</center><p><br><br> Peter looked at John, who looked away. All of the disciples were avoiding each other's eyes as the realization came: the master of the house had neglected to provide any servant to wash their dusty, dirty feet!</p><p>彼得看著約翰，約翰把目光移開。 當人們意識到時，所有的門徒都在躲避對方的眼睛：房子的主人忽略了提供任何僕人來洗他們塵土飛揚的髒腳！</p><p><br> They were all at table, almost ready to begin. Jesus, with John beside Him -- as the youngest, John was always right next to Jesus -- Matthew, Bartholomew, Thomas, Judas Iscariot, Peter, James, Andrew, Thaddeus, Simon, Philip and the other James, the son of Alphaeus.</p><p>他們都坐到了餐桌旁，幾乎準備開始了。耶穌，約翰在他身邊──身為最年輕的使徒，約翰總是在耶穌旁邊──馬太、巴多羅買、多馬、加略人猶大、彼得、雅各、安得烈、達太、西門、腓力和亞勒腓的兒子雅各。</p><p><br> They had grown accustomed to the VIP treatment meted out to them as Jesus' celebrity had increased exponentially.</p><p>隨著耶穌的名人呈指數級增長，他們已經習慣了對他們的貴賓待遇。</p><p><br> Now, all were in a quandary.</p><p>現在，所有的使徒都不知道該怎麼辦了。</p><p><br> <em>If I do it, I'll be lowering myself,</em> thought Peter, looking meaningfully at John, whom he liked to consider his deputy.</p><p>如果我這樣做，我會降低自己，彼得想，有意義地看著約翰，他喜歡把他當作他的副手。</p><p><br> John avoided Peter's eyes. <em>He isn't going to rope me into doing the servant's job! Not this time!</em> he thought, steeling himself to withstand Peter's naturally overbearing personality.</p><p>約翰避開了彼得的眼睛。 他不會騙我去做僕人的工作！這次不行！ 他想，為了抵擋彼得天生的霸道性格而強行。</p><p><br> The other disciples looked at each other uncomfortably. Judas Iscariot had already made up his mind not to involve himself in the petty quarrels in which the others sometimes engaged. He had higher matters to consider -- like determining exactly when would be the best time to hand Jesus over to the Chief Priests... and truly earn that bag of Tyrian shekels that were burning a hole in his pocket.</p><p>其他門徒不舒服地看著對方。 加略人猶大已經下定決心不捲入其他人有時捲入的小爭吵中。 他有更高的考慮事項要考慮——比如確切地確定何時是將耶穌交給祭司長的最佳時機......並真正賺取那袋在他的口袋裡燒了一個洞的提謝克爾。</p><p><br> After enduring several moments of silent jockeying for position among His chosen Apostles, Jesus sighed.</p><p>在忍受了幾次默默地爭奪他選擇的使徒中的位置後，耶穌嘆了口氣。</p><p><br> He'd known in advance what He was going to do. His Father had made it clear. But the obvious rivalry between His closest friends and followers told Him they all still had a long way to go.</p><p>他事先知道他要做什麼。 他的父親已經說清楚了。 但他最親密的朋友和追隨者之間的明顯競爭告訴他，他們還有很長的路要走。</p><p><br> He stood up.</p><p>他站起來了。</p><p><br> All eyes turned to Him rather guiltily, as if expecting Him to now clarify which of them was the low man on the apostolic totem pole. Every man breathed a silent prayer in his heart that Jesus would not ask him to "do the honours"...</p><p>所有的目光都相當內疚地轉向他，彷彿期待他現在澄清他們中誰是使徒圖騰柱上的低等人。每個人都在心裡默默地祈禱，祈求耶穌不要要求他「做僕人」…</p><p><br></p><center>💠</center><p><br><br> When Jesus got to Peter, Peter roused himself from his dumbfounded reverie.</p><p>當耶穌來到彼得身邊時，彼得從他目瞪口呆的遐想中振作起來。</p><p><br> "Lord? Are <em>You</em> going to wash <em>my</em> feet?!"</p><p>「主啊？你要給我洗腳嗎？！」</p><p><br> They had all been stunned... and silent... but Peter's question awoke them from their own bewildered trances.</p><p>他們都驚呆了......沉默了......但彼得的問題把他們從自己困惑的恍惚中喚醒。</p><p><br> Jesus had taken off His big cloak, tied a towel around His waist, taken a large basin of clean water, and proceeded to "do the honours" Himself, as if He were nothing more than a common household slave!</p><p>耶穌脫下他的大斗篷，把毛巾綁在腰上，拿了一大盆乾淨的水，然後自己「做僕人」，好像他只不過是一個普通的家庭奴隸！</p><p><br> Going around to each of the Apostles in turn, He knelt down, placed their feet in the water-filled basin, and washed off all the dirt, dust and grime with His own hands. He then towelled the clean feet dry using the towel around His waist.</p><p>他依次走到每個使徒身邊，跪下，把他們的腳放在裝滿水的盆子裡，用自己的雙手洗掉所有的汙垢、灰塵和汙垢。 然後他用腰間的毛巾擦乾他們乾淨的腳。</p><p><br> As usual, Peter had been the first to find his words.</p><p>像往常一樣，彼得是第一個找到他的話的人。</p><p><br></p><center>💠</center><p><br><br> "You do not know what I am doing now," responded Jesus gently, "but afterwards, you will know."</p><p>「你不知道我現在在做什麼，」 耶穌溫和地回答， 「但之後，你會知道的。」</p><p><br> Indignation rose in Peter at His beloved Lord and Master's total humiliation in taking on a servant's role. It was unthinkable!</p><p>彼得對他心愛的主和主人在扮演僕人的角色時完全羞辱而感到憤慨。 這是不可想象的！</p><p><br> <em>"No!"</em> He spoke decisively and more loudly than he had intended. He didn't understand why, but something about Jesus' willingness to lower Himself in this way frightened him. It seemed unnatural...</p><p>「不！」 他說話果斷，聲音比他預期的要大。 他不明白為什麼，但耶穌願意以這種方式降低自己，這讓他感到害怕。 這似乎不自然......</p><p><br> He pulled his feet away.</p><p>他把腳拉開了。</p><p><br> "You shall <em>never</em> wash my feet!"</p><p>「你永遠不會洗我的腳！」</p><p><br> Jesus looked at Peter kindly. He had expected some pushback from His most outspoken, impulsive follower. And He knew something else about Peter that saddened Him immeasurably...</p><p>耶穌親切地看著彼得。 他本以為他最直言不諱、衝動的追隨者會有所反擊。 他知道關於彼得的其他事情，這讓他感到難以估量的悲傷......</p><p><br> "If I do not wash you, you have no part with Me," He explained gently.</p><p>「如果我不洗你，你就不會和我在一起，」 他溫柔地解釋道。</p><p><br> Peter was shocked at this statement. <em>No part with Jesus?!</em></p><p>彼得對這句話感到震驚。他不會和耶穌在一起嗎？</p><p><br> Now <em>that</em> was <em>truly</em> unthinkable.</p><p>現在這確實是不可想象的。</p><p><br> With all his resistance melted away, Peter spoke urgently.</p><p>隨著他所有的抵抗都消失了，彼得緊急地說話了。</p><p><br> "Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head!"</p><p>「主啊，不要只洗我的腳，還要洗我的手和頭！」</p><p><br> Jesus smiled as He proceeded to wash just Peter's feet. "The one who has been bathed only needs to wash his feet, and he is completely clean," He explained.</p><p>耶穌微笑著只洗彼得的腳。 他解釋說，「洗過澡的人只需要洗腳，而且他完全乾淨。」</p><p><br> "And all of you are clean --" He added, then paused. <em>"Yet not all."</em></p><p>「你們都乾淨了——」他補充道，然後停了下來。 「但不是你們所有人。」</p><p><br></p><center>💠</center><p><br><br> Judas Iscariot was troubled by that last statement, spoken in his direction, he thought... or had he imagined it?</p><p>加略人猶大對最後那句話感到不安，他想，這句話是針對他說的……還是他想像出來的？</p><p><br> He had looked down for a moment while feeling once again for the bag of Tyrian shekels in his pocket -- just to make sure they were there -- when Jesus had made that last, rather pointed statement.</p><p>當耶穌做出最後一個相當尖銳的宣告時，他低頭看了一會兒，再次感覺到口袋裡的一袋提爾謝克爾——只是為了確保它們在那裡——所以他不確定耶穌在說誰。</p><p><br> <em>Of course,</em> betraying Jesus bothered him! What man alive could betray this young, innocent, powerful, amazingly good man and not feel some measure of regret?</p><p>當然，背叛耶穌困擾著他！ 活著的人能背叛這個年輕、無辜、有權勢、令人驚訝的好人，而不會感到某種程度的遺憾？</p><p><br> <em>But Jesus shouldn't have wasted all that money!</em> he reminded himself rather fiercely.</p><p>但耶穌不應該浪費那麼多錢！ 他非常強烈地提醒自己。</p><p><br> And it would turn out alright.</p><p>一切都會好起來的。</p><p><br> What the chief priests didn't know was Jesus' talent for escaping those who wanted to kill Him.</p><p>祭司長們不知道的是耶穌逃脫那些想殺死他的人的天賦。</p><p><br> Time and again, when people had tried to seize Him, Jesus had simply, easily walked away.</p><p>一次又一次，當人們試圖抓住他時，耶穌只是輕而易舉地走了。</p><p><br> Once, in His hometown of Nazareth, he had enraged the entire community to the point where they had forced Him to the top of the cliff on which the town was built and tried to throw Him off.</p><p>有一次，在他的家鄉拿撒勒，他激怒了整個社區，他們將他強行推到城鎮所在的懸崖頂上，並試圖將他從懸崖上扔下去。</p><p><br> Jesus had walked away from that, too.</p><p>耶穌也離開了那個。</p><p><br> Unscathed.</p><p>毫無損。</p><p><br> And He never took revenge on His attackers, either.</p><p>他也從未向攻擊者報仇。</p><p><br> Judas knew it would turn out alright. Jesus would escape no matter what Judas did.</p><p>猶大知道事情會好起來的。 無論猶大做什麼，耶穌會逃脫。</p><p><br> And then he would have truly earned his precious reward!</p><p>然後他真的賺到了寶貴的回報！</p><p><br></p><center>💠</center><p><br><br> <em>Based on John 13:1-11.</em></p><p>基於約翰福音13：1-11。</p><p><br></p><center>💠</center>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://truth-about-jesus.github.io/posts/allroads</guid><title>Do all roads lead to God?  所有道路都通向上帝嗎？</title><description>What about other religions?  其他宗教呢？</description><link>https://truth-about-jesus.github.io/posts/allroads</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 May 2024 09:30:00 -0400</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do all roads lead to God?</p><p>所有道路都通向上帝嗎？</p><p><br> What about other religions?</p><p>其他宗教呢？</p><p><br> How many ways are there?</p><p>有多少條路？</p><p><br></p><center>💠</center><p><br><br> While teaching His followers on a mountain, Jesus spoke of two possible ways one can go in life.</p><p>當耶穌在山上教導門徒時，他談到了兩條可能的人生道路。</p><p><br></p><h5><em>Matthew 7:13-14 (ESV)</em></h5><h6><br></h6><p>13 “Enter by the narrow gate.

It was awfully quiet now!</p><p>以撒好奇地看著他們，等待有人說話。 現在很安靜！</p><p><br></p><center>💠</center><p><br><br> The nice man sat down, and called the others to sit as well, so they all slowly sat down.</p><p>好心人坐了下來，又叫其他人也坐下，於是他們都慢慢地坐下了。</p><p><br> Isaac sat down, too, but then the nice man turned to him.</p><p>以撒也坐下來，但隨後這個好人轉向他。</p><p><br> “Little fella, how about you come here in the middle?”</p><p>「小傢伙，你中間過來怎麼樣？」</p><p><br> Isaac got up and stepped forward shyly. The nice man picked him up and placed him gently in his lap, then turned to the others, speaking quietly.</p><p>以撒站起來，害羞地向前走去。 好心的男人把他抱起來，輕輕放在腿上，然後轉向其他人，輕聲說。</p><p><br> “Whoever wants to be first will be last of all, and servant of all.”</p><p>「誰想成為第一，誰就會成為最後一個，成為所有人的僕人。」</p><p><br> The other men frowned.

A little abashed, he buried his face in the rough folds of the nice man's clothing, feeling almost safer than he did with Mommy.</p><p>大漢們盯著以撒，再次皺了皺眉頭。 他感到害羞，把臉埋在好人衣服粗糙的褶皺裡。 他感覺幾乎比和母親在一起更安全。</p><p><br></p><center>💠</center><p><br><br> “Whoever receives one child like this in My Name, receives Me.”</p><p>「凡以我的名接待這樣一個孩子的人，就是接待了我。」</p><p><br> “And whoever causes one of these little ones believing in Me to stumble, it would be better for him to have a heavy millstone hung around his neck, and be submerged in the depths of the sea.”</p><p>「無論誰讓這些相信我的小孩子跌倒，對他來說，最好在他的脖子上掛上一塊沉重的磨石，並浸入海底深處。」</p><p><br> This made Isaac shiver a little and snuggle in deeper.</p><p>這讓以撒有點顫抖，依偎得更深。</p><p><br> “Woe to the world because of stumbling blocks!

He looked down.</p><p>「我們正在爭論誰更偉大，耶穌，」他平靜地承認。 他低下頭。</p><p><br> Jesus caught his eye and smiled, and John immediately felt better.</p><p>耶穌看著他微笑，約翰立刻感覺好多了。</p><p><br></p><center>💠</center><p><br><br> The other disciples began to chime in slowly.</p><p>其他弟子也開始慢慢附和。</p><p><br> “Yeah.”</p><p>「是的。」</p><p><br> “We didn't know, Lord.”</p><p>「我們不知道，主。」</p><p><br></p><center>💠</center><p><br><br> One of the men caught Hoppy and picked him up gently.
