The young Gentile convert to the Jewish faith had come all the way to Judea from Parthia, his homeland, to celebrate the Passover.

well over a month ago --

\

he'd stayed on in Jerusalem.

\

For some reason, he didn't feel ready to leave...

In Jerusalem, the young Parthian had met Jews from all over Israel:

在耶路撒冷，年輕的帕提亞人遇到了來自以色列各地的猶太人：

\

Judea, the Jordan, Galilee...

猶太、約旦、加利利......

*and* Jews and other Gentile converts from all over the world:

Elam, Media, Asia, Egypt, Rome, Arabia... and more!

伊拉姆、媒體、亞洲、埃及、羅馬、阿拉伯......以及更多！

It had been a very unusual -- actually *disturbing* -- Passover this year...!

\

who'd claimed to be a "king"...

\

*even...* the Son of God!

at the insistence of the Jews.

\

Then, several days later, rumours had spread that the same rabbi's followers had *stolen* His body!

Arshak had been troubled and intrigued by these strange incidents...

\
\

To relate to the locals better, Arshak had learned to speak Aramaic passably well. 

為了更好地與當地人建立聯絡，阿爾沙克學會了說好亞拉姆語。

\

This was the language the Jews spoke among themselves -- 

這是猶太人之間所說的語言——

\

with some regional variations... like in Galilee.

有一些地區差異......比如在加利利。

\

So --

所以——

\

*why* was there a Galilean Jew, standing *right* in front of him, telling him of *wonderful* things God had done --

*not* in the standard Aramaic of Jerusalem, *nor* in the Galilean dialect,

\

nor *even* in Hebrew or Greek! --

甚至用希伯來語或希臘語！--

甚至連希伯來文或希臘文都不會！ ——

\

but in *Parthian* -- Arshak's *own* mother tongue --

但在帕提亞語中——阿爾沙克自己的母語——

\

even... the very *dialect* he had learned 

甚至......他學過的方言

\

as a *child?!*
