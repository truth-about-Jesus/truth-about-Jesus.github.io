He created them male and female.</p><p><br></p><center>🧩</center><p><br><br> since the image of God is both male and female, it stands to reason that, as far as gender goes, an androgynous person more fully represents God's image than someone who is only one gender or the other.</p><p><br></p><center>🧩</center><p><br><br> a traditional married couple can be considered a third gender, since they become one flesh encompassing both genders.</p><p><br> Genesis 2:24 (ESV) 24 Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.</p><p><br></p><center>🧩</center><p><br><br> God Himself states through the prophet Jeremiah that He has created a third gender.</p><p><br> Jeremiah 31:22 (MKJV) 22 How long will you turn to and fro, O faithless daughter? For Jehovah has created a new thing in the land; a woman [Hebrew word for the female body] shall enclose a man [Hebrew word for a warrior or man of authority].</p><p><br></p><center>🧩</center><p><br><br> God says there can be a dichotomy between what is inside and what is outside, but that He is most interested in what is inside.</p><p><br> 1 Samuel 16:7 (ESV) 7 But the LORD said to Samuel, “Do not look on his appearance or on the height of his stature, because I have rejected him. For the LORD sees not as man sees: man looks on the outward appearance, but the LORD looks on the heart.”</p><p><br></p><center>🧩</center><p><br><br> Jesus mentioned, and approved of, a third gender: eunuchs.</p><p><br> Matthew 19:10-12 (ESV) 10 The disciples said to him, “If such is the case of a man with his wife, it is better not to marry.” 11 But he said to them, “Not everyone can receive this saying, but only those to whom it is given. 12 For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let the one who is able to receive this receive it.”</p><p><br></p><center>🧩</center><p><br><br> the Apostle Paul states that in Christ male and female no longer matter.</p><p><br> Galatians 3:28 (ESV) 28 There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.</p><p><br></p><center>🧩</center><p><br><br> therefore, there really are more than two genders and, according to the Bible, transgender, non-binary and intersex people are, at worst, a non-issue, and at best, created, designed and approved by God.</p></div><span>Tagged with 標記為: </span><ul class="tag-list"><li><a href="/tags/gender">gender</a></li><li><a href="/tags/bible">Bible</a></li><li><a href="/tags/god">God</a></li><li><a href="/tags/jesus">Jesus</a></li><li><a href="/tags/paul">Paul</a></li></ul></article></div><footer><p>🌐 <a href="https://truthaboutjesus-github-io.translate.goog/?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp">Translate this website with Google</a></p><p>🌐 <a href="https://truthaboutjesus-github-io.translate.goog/?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp">用谷歌翻譯這個網站</a></p><p>Generated using 使用生成的 <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a></p><p><a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed 提要</a></p></footer></body></html>
