See that you are not alarmed, for all these things must take place, but the end is not yet.</p><p>7 For nation will rise up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines, plagues, and earthquakes in various places.</p><p>8 But all these things are the beginning of the labor pains.”</p><p><br> He even says things will get much worse!</p><p><br></p><h5><em>Luke 21:25-26 (TCENT)</em></h5><h6><br></h6><p>25 “There will be signs in the sun, moon, and stars, and on the earth there will be distress among the nations as they are perplexed by the roaring sea and the surging waves.</p><p>26 People will faint from fear and foreboding of what is coming upon the world, for the powers of the heavens will be shaken.”</p><p><br> but at the end of it all, He will come back to take His children home.</p><p><br></p><h5><em>Luke 21:27-28 (TCENT)</em></h5><h6><br></h6><p>27 “Then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.</p><p>28 So when these things begin to take place, stand tall and lift up your heads, for your redemption is near.”</p><p><br></p><center>💠</center><p><br><br> it is tempting in times like these, while waiting for Jesus to come take us home, to try to escape our worries and fears by getting caught up in various distractions, but Jesus warns us against mere escapism:</p><h5><em>Luke 21:34-36 (TCENT)</em></h5><h6><br></h6><p>34 “Watch yourselves, lest your hearts be weighed down with carousing, drunkenness, and the cares of this life, and that day come upon you suddenly.</p><p>35 For it will come like a trap upon all who dwell on the face of the whole earth.</p><p>36 Therefore stay alert at all times, praying that you may be considered worthy to escape everything that will take place, and to stand before the Son of Man.”</p><p><br></p><center>💠</center><p><br><br> in fact, Jesus reassures us that we don't need to worry because God is our Father who knows and cares for our needs.</p><p><br></p><h5><em>Matthew 6:25-32 (GNB)</em></h5><h6><br></h6><p>25 "This is why I tell you: do not be worried about the food and drink you need in order to stay alive, or about clothes for your body. After all, isn't life worth more than food? And isn't the body worth more than clothes?</p><p>26 Look at the birds: they do not plant seeds, gather a harvest and put it in barns; yet your Father in heaven takes care of them! Aren't you worth much more than birds?</p><p>27 Can any of you live a bit longer by worrying about it?</p><p><br> 28 "And why worry about clothes? Look how the wild flowers grow: they do not work or make clothes for themselves.</p><p>29 But I tell you that not even King Solomon with all his wealth had clothes as beautiful as one of these flowers.</p><p>30 It is God who clothes the wild grass—grass that is here today and gone tomorrow, burned up in the oven. Won't he be all the more sure to clothe you? What little faith you have!</p><p><br> 31 "So do not start worrying: 'Where will my food come from? or my drink? or my clothes?'</p><p>32 (These are the things the pagans are always concerned about.) Your Father in heaven knows that you need all these things.</p><p><br> in these verses Jesus speaks specifically of food and clothing, but we can expect that God, our loving Heavenly Father, will take care of all our needs, including a safe place to live, breathe and grow.</p><p><br></p><center>💠</center><p><br><br> but then why are so many in trouble and need at this time?</p><p><br> perhaps this is the key: Jesus commands us to spend our time not chasing after the things we need, nor trying to escape through distractions, but doing something far more essential and productive:</p><p><br></p><h5><em>Matthew 6:33 (ESV)</em></h5><h6><br></h6><p>33 But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.</p><p><br> as we do so, we will be taken care of on a daily basis, and we will not need to be afraid.</p><p><br></p><h5><em>Matthew 6:34 (NET)</em></h5><h6><br></h6><p>34 So then, do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Today has enough trouble of its own.</p><p><br></p><center>💠</center><p><br><br> but -- how exactly do we "seek first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness"?</p><p><br> we can start here: would you like to belong to God's family?</p><p><br> and find out more of what Jesus means by reading what He says in the Gospels: the books of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John in the Bible.</p><p><br></p><center>💠</center><p><br><br> Jesus strongly encouraged His followers to remain in His word:</p><h5><em>John 8:31-32 (TCENT)</em></h5><h6><br></h6><p>31 Then Jesus said to the Jews who had believed in him, “If you abide in my word, you are truly my disciples.</p><p>32 Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”</p><p><br> Jesus’ words will still be in force when everything else has been destroyed. He said:</p><p><br></p><h5><em>Luke 21:33 (TCENT)</em></h5><h6><br></h6><p>33 “Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will certainly not pass away.”</p><p><br></p><center>💠</center><p><br><br></p><h5><em>Revelation 21:1-8 (ESV)</em></h5><h6><br></h6><p>1 Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea was no more.</p><p><br> 2 And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.</p><p><br> 3 And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, “Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God.</p><p>4 He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.”</p><p><br> 5 And he who was seated on the throne said, “Behold, I am making all things new.” Also he said, “Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true.”</p><p><br> 6 And he said to me, “It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. To the thirsty I will give from the spring of the water of life without payment.</p><p>7 The one who conquers will have this heritage, and I will be his God and he will be my son.</p><p><br> 8 But as for the cowardly, the faithless, the detestable, as for murderers, the sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars, their portion will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death.”</p><p><br></p><center>💠</center></div><span>Tagged with 標記為: </span><ul class="tag-list"><li><a href="/tags/hope">hope</a></li><li><a href="/tags/jesus">Jesus</a></li><li><a href="/tags/climate-change">climate change</a></li><li><a href="/tags/disasters">disasters</a></li><li><a href="/tags/catastrophes">catastrophes</a></li><li><a href="/tags/pandemic">pandemic</a></li><li><a href="/tags/war">war</a></li><li><a href="/tags/trouble">trouble</a></li><li><a href="/tags/future">future</a></li><li><a href="/tags/gospels">Gospels</a></li><li><a href="/tags/fear">fear</a></li><li><a href="/tags/worry">worry</a></li><li><a href="/tags/provision">provision</a></li></ul></article></div><footer class="translate-link"><p>🌐 <a href="https://truth--about--jesus-github-io.translate.goog/?_x_tr_sl=zh-TW&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp">Translate this website with Google</a></p><p>🌐 <a href="https://truth--about--jesus-github-io.translate.goog/?_x_tr_sl=en&_x_tr_tl=zh-TW&_x_tr_hl=zh-TW&_x_tr_pto=wapp">用谷歌翻譯這個網站</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Generated using 使用生成的 Publish</a></p><p><a href="https://opendyslexic.org">English font 英語字型: OpenDyslexic-Alta</a></p><p style="margin-bottom: 40px;"><a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed 提要</a></p></footer></body></html>
