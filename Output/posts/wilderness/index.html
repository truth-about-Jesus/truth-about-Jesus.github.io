And there I will give her her vineyards and make the Valley of Achor a door of hope. And there she shall answer as in the days of her youth, as at the time when she came out of the land of Egypt.</em></p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>“And in that day, declares the LORD, you will call me ‘My Husband,’ and no longer will you call me ‘My Baal.’</em></p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>“For I will remove the names of the Baals from her mouth, and they shall be remembered by name no more.” (Hosea 2:14-17, ESV)</em></p><p><br></p><center>🔹🟣🔹</center><p><br></p><h2>into the wilderness</h2><p>Over the past seven or eight years, i’ve sensed God calling me away from social involvement. gradually, i stopped attending gatherings with family and friends. i deleted my accounts on social media. and i played — and then stopped playing — ice hockey.</p><p><br> i came to understand that God was offering me a choice between being either social or creative: i chose to be creative. it also became more and more clear that i was an introvert, despite earlier appearances; i found this new quiet life much more relaxing and enjoyable.</p><p><br> i had always believed that the only way to serve God was by being social: by leading or teaching in an organized ministry. but i felt like God was trying to teach me that there are many ways to serve Him — even as an introvert.</p><p><br></p><center>📖</center><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>But the Lord answered her, “Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things, but one thing is necessary. Mary has chosen the good portion, which will not be taken away from her.” (Luke 10:41-42, ESV)</em></p><p><br></p><center>🔹</center><p><br> finally, almost nothing social remained on our calendar, except church on Sundays. my hubby Henry and son Jared and i were attending a small church not far from our home fairly regularly, although we had not really gotten to know anyone there as yet. i guess i was still hoping i might eventually get involved with the worship team or some other form of ministry there, since that was how i’d grown up — actively serving in the church. but it was becoming more and more clear that God had other plans for me that were outside of my expectations.</p><p><br> on December 15th, 2019 we attended what turned out to be our last service at that church together as a family. that day we were creating Christmas tree ornaments with balloons, jute and glue, sitting around large round tables with others in the congregation. because our ornaments were still wet, we had to leave them hanging up to dry.</p><p><br> the rest of the church was going to stay for lunch, but we had other plans. Henry and Jared went out to the car while i was waylaid by one of the women inviting me to join the lunch. i explained to her that my hubby and son were waiting for me, and she graciously let me go.</p><p><br> all that next week, i was down with the flu. i finally got better for a week, then came down with another flu for a third week. by that time we had missed all of the remaining Sunday church services in 2019.</p><p><br> around that time, God started to speak to me from His Word about going out to the wilderness. i didn’t really understand — not yet. but i’ve noticed He tends to get the ball rolling in telling me things i don’t understand or pick up on right away, so that later when i finally do get the message, i can look back through my journal and realize that He had been speaking to me about that for a while.</p><p><br></p><center>📖</center><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>But the woman was given the two wings of the great eagle so that she might fly from the serpent into the wilderness, to the place where she is to be nourished for a time, and times, and half a time. (Revelation 12:14, ESV)</em></p><p><br></p><center>🔹</center><p><br> i struggled with this calling to the wilderness over and over and over again. every time i asked God for confirmation, He graciously gave it. every time someone invited me to something and i felt bad once again for not being there, and i asked Him yet again whether it was really from Him, God kindly gave me another word about being in the wilderness, until there could be no question anymore.</p><p><br></p><center>📖</center><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>And the child grew and became strong in spirit, and he was in the wilderness until the day of his public appearance to Israel. (Luke 1:80, ESV)</em></p><p><br></p><center>🔹🟣🔹</center><p><br></p><h2>wait — what?!</h2><p>while i was down with my first week of flu, the church sent out their usual weekly announcement email, and one item in particular caught me by surprise.</p><p><br> it was the screening of a video of two women getting married — to each other! i felt very troubled and concerned.</p><p><br> up until that moment, i had not realized that this church, which God had clearly been leading us to attend for the past five months, was pro-LGBTQ.</p><p><br> i didn’t have much experience or knowledge about anything LGBTQ-related. my best friend Drew in grade school had turned out to be gay, apparently, but we had drifted apart after grade 5, and i had only found out from someone else after we had both already graduated from high school and lost contact.</p><p><br> then there had been no personal contact with anyone LGBTQ — at least, not that i was aware of — until my beginner women’s ice hockey team only a few years ago: at least three women on my team had been lesbians. one was our coach; the other two, i eventually found out, were married to each other. they were the kindest, most trustworthy members of our team, as far as i could tell.</p><p><br> but through my times of reading through the Bible, i had occasionally come across that word “homosexuality” — and not in any positive sense. it was always in one of Paul’s lists of sins. so i honestly thought the Bible was pretty clear about such matters. i also assumed the reason God had destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah was because they were all homosexuals...</p><p><br> then there was the local Pride Parade, which i had sometimes seen televised: folks dressed flamboyantly and sometimes rather skimpily...</p><p><br> and the news headlines — back during the beginning of the AIDS crisis, every so often some preacher would make headlines condemning gays and using the epidemic to prove that God was judging them.</p><p><br> and then there was the issue of legalizing gay marriage: it seemed to me that most prominent, well-respected Christian leaders, like Billy Graham and James Dobson, were all against it.</p><p><br> and more recently i had seen a headline about lesbians trying to drive a Christian baker out of business because he had refused to make their wedding cake...</p><p><br> so even though my two personal encounters with LGBTQ folks were overwhelmingly positive, what i read in the Bible and saw in the news and on TV was quite negative.</p><p><br> so... why did it seem like this church was actually promoting gay marriage?!</p><p><br></p><center>🔹🟣🔹</center><p><br></p><h2>“you can learn something”</h2><p>while i was still recovering from my first bout of the flu in December 2019, i had difficulty sleeping because of a lingering cough. in the early morning hours of the 23rd, i had a dream in which i saw links to two LGBTQ websites. when i pulled something from them, i discovered i could sleep better without coughing.</p><p><br> it seemed to me from this dream that Jesus was saying to me, “Enid, you can learn something from LGBTQ folks.” then He gave me this thought-provoking verse:</p><p><br></p><center>📖</center><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>“My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge; because you have rejected knowledge, I reject you from being a priest to me. And since you have forgotten the law of your God, I also will forget your children.” (Hosea 4:6, ESV)</em></p><p><br></p><center>🔹</center><p><br> i was definitely getting the impression that Jesus was calling me out for my ignorance of the whole LGBTQ question! still, i was reluctant to expose myself to something that could possibly be a snare to me...</p><p><br> whenever we saw same-sex attraction portrayed on TV — usually a kiss between two women or two men — i would look away. my husband thought i was looking away because i was disgusted by sin, but in reality i was looking away because i was trying to avoid being tempted myself... a subtle but real difference.</p><p><br> i felt there might be some temptation there. i had a vague notion — perhaps i’d heard it somewhere — that people became gay because of, well, parental failures. i definitely had experienced what i considered fairly serious “parental failures” growing up, so i thought it prudent to keep away from such temptations at all costs, as i thought i might be particularly susceptible.</p><p><br> and i remembered when Wendy Gritter of New Direction, a Christian ministry reaching out to gays, had spoken at our church some 20-plus years ago. she had said that she had gay friends who wanted her to consider their alternative interpretation of Scripture as accepting of LGBTQ folks, but did not go into any actual detail. since it seemed to me that the Bible was unmistakably clear on this matter, i had assumed that whatever they had to say must be some kind of insidious deception that i should definitely avoid.</p><p><br> so my whole approach to anything LGBTQ was pretty simple: avoidance.</p><p><br> but now it looked like Jesus didn’t want me to avoid the issue any longer! okay, yeah, probably i could learn something from LGBTQ folks. it seemed to me i could learn something from anyone — if i tried hard enough! but — didn’t the dangers far outweigh the benefits?! how could Jesus ask this of me?!</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>“my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge...”</em></p><p><br> as i puzzled over this apparent contradiction, suddenly a question popped into my mind: “what if Jared is gay?”</p><p><br> i was instantly highly motivated.</p><p><br></p><center>🧩</center><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>(i held out for as long as i could, but eventually, when the opportunity arose — i don’t exactly remember how — i did ask Jared, a little nervously, and he assured me unequivocally that he was straight.)</em></p><p><br></p><center>🔹🟣🔹</center><p><br></p><h2>a living apology</h2><p>since the only person i had ever heard of being involved in Christian ministry to gays was Wendy Gritter, i did a search for her on the internet.</p><p><br> i discovered that her organization, New Direction, had morphed into something else entirely, called “Generous Space". there was a “living apology” on their website for something called “ex-gay” ministry, which, as i read further, turned out to be well-meaning but apparently misguided attempts on the part of Christians to help gays divest themselves of same-sex attraction — i.e., conversion therapy.</p><p><br> really? that was a bad thing? when i had heard about it 20 years ago, i had been heartened to learn that someone was reaching out to gays. what exactly were they apologizing for?</p><p><br> as i read further and followed links to <a href="https://beyondexgay.com/narratives.html">ex-gay survivor stories</a>, i discovered that Generous Space no longer considered being gay a choice — or sin. they no longer considered it necessary for gays to try to become heterosexual...</p><p><br> my mind was boggled. this ministry had done a 180-degree about-face! how had this happened?!</p><p><br> i read through some of the <a href="https://beyondexgay.com/narratives.html">ex-gay survivor stories</a>. that night, December 23, 2019, i had a revelation which i recorded in my journal the next morning:</p><p><br></p><center>📝</center><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>in the night i realized that those "ex-gay" programs weren't good because they didn't encourage honesty, they didn't treat people the way they would like to be treated, they involved judging. they weren't like Jesus. they were something else.</em></p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>lgbtq+ people should be allowed to be honest, they should be treated with respect, they should not be judged -- just like everyone else.</em></p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>i wouldn't like anyone to focus on "fixing me" -- i've experienced that, too. i like the way You do things, Papa God, Lord Jesus and Mama Holy Spirit. You aren't harsh like people are. You are Gentle, Kind, Merciful, Loving. (December 24, 2019)</em></p><p><br></p><center>🔹🟣🔹</center><p><br></p><h2>the blog</h2><p>i decided i needed to read Wendy Gritter’s blog from the very beginning to understand how her thinking had evolved. i was still skeptical, but now curious to understand how it was that a ministry that had once actively promoted sexual orientation change was now apologizing for doing so.</p><p><br> i started at the very beginning of the blog posted on the Generous Space website. the first post was dated June 3, 2008, and there were a lot of posts! this was going to take a while.</p><p><br> i won’t pretend i understood everything she wrote. as far as i can tell, she thinks at a much deeper level than i do, quite honestly.</p><p><br> but i watched as her thinking gradually evolved from the more traditional concept that same-sex attraction is a problem that leads people into sin that requires repentance... to an assertion that “covenanted same-sex unions ought to be considered a disputable matter” (in seven parts!) ... to “affirming the relationships, families, gifts, and ministry contributions of LGBTQ2+ people”!</p><p><br> wow. that was... wow.</p><p><br> i wasn’t ready to go that far — not yet. but it was thought-provoking to see a deep, honest thinker like Wendy Gritter change her stance so dramatically.</p><p><br></p><center>🔹🟣🔹</center><p><br></p><h2>Justin Lee</h2><p>sometime in January 2020, i arrived at Wendy Gritter’s blog post dated January 13, 2011 about the Gay Christian Network and Justin Lee.</p><p><br> i was curious about Justin Lee but a little leery of leaving the safety of Wendy’s careful, Bible-based thinking for an unknown, unpredictable quantity. then she wrote about him again in her November 2012 blog post.</p><p><br> curiosity won out, and after searching on his name i found myself at his website, <a href="https://geekyjustin.com">geekyjustin.com</a>.</p><p><br> i was very curious about him; i had seen Wendy Gritter speak and even spoken to her in person, so i had an idea of what kind of person she was. Justin Lee was a completely unknown entity.</p><p><br> i wanted to see how he spoke: did he have shifty eyes? how trustworthy was he?</p><p><br> so i decided to watch his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJVXWimD9w0">video testimony on YouTube</a>.</p><p><br> i found him to be a sincere, bright, honest young man, a totally committed follower of Jesus who wanted to serve God and cared deeply about what the Bible said.</p><p><br> and when he had discovered he was gay, in his early teens — he was horrified.</p><p><br> wow. that was not how i had imagined gay folks to be. i could relate to Justin Lee! he loved Jesus at least as much as i did. and he had reacted as any serious believer might, upon discovering he was same-sex attracted.</p><p><br> i was boggled.</p><p><br> same-sex attraction was not a choice after all. it was something you were born with. you didn’t get to decide — you got it whether you wanted it or not.</p><p><br> i had thought it was a sin, but now understanding that it had not been a choice for Justin Lee — that he had spent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_FqndcGmKI&t=307s">endless nights crying and praying, begging God to make him heterosexual</a> — i saw very clearly that it could not possibly be a sin, since there was no decision-making involved.</p><p><br> i was going to have to revamp my entire way of thinking about such matters.</p><p><br></p><center>🔹🟣🔹</center><p><br></p><h2>the poor and needy</h2><p>as i read and researched and surfed further, i discovered horrific acts of violence perpetrated against LGBTQ folks — not just the spiritual/ psychological violence perpetrated by ex-gay ministries, but actual physical attacks.</p><p><br> like what happened to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Shepard">Matthew Shepard</a>.</p><p><br> i began to see that LGBTQ folks were the “poor and needy” for whom Papa God showed special concern in the Bible.</p><p><br></p><center>📖</center><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>“Because the poor are plundered, because the needy groan, I will now arise,” says the LORD; “I will place him in the safety for which he longs.” (Psalms 12:5, ESV)</em></p><p><br></p><center>🔹</center><p><br> even if Papa God had a problem with these people before, i mused, surely now, seeing how badly they are being treated, He stands with them. i know His Heart. He is not like these people so obsessed with rules that people no longer matter. He is broken-hearted over the way people are treating them.</p><p><br> i felt heart-broken, too.</p><p><br></p><center>🔹🟣🔹</center><p><br></p><h2>tax collectors and prostitutes</h2><p>Jesus hung out with tax collectors and prostitutes, eating and drinking, loving and teaching and healing, while the religious leaders of His day stood back and made disapproving comments.</p><p><br> He said to them:</p><p><br></p><center>📖</center><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>“Truly, I say to you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes go into the kingdom of God before you.” (Matthew 21:31, ESV)</em></p><p><br></p><center>🔹🟣🔹</center><p><br></p><h2>for those tears i died</h2><p>when i discovered <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/GeekyJustin">Justin Lee’s YouTube channel</a> in January 2020, i also discovered his YouTube show: <em>GeekyJustin Live</em>. the first season, "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbidsuZsGmyinfZjjBedotjOv3WPACAsA">LGBTQ and Christian</a>", featured interviews with people i had never heard of before: Kathy Baldock, Matthew Vines, Danny Cortez, Austen Hartke...</p><p><br> one of them, Marsha Stevens-Pino, it turned out, was the writer of a song i had sung many times when i was younger: <em><a href="https://www.higherpraise.com/lyrics6/f/2918.htm">For Those Tears I Died</a>.</em></p><p><br></p><center>🎹</center><p><br> <em>You said you'd come and share all my sorrows,</em></p><p><br> <em>You said you'd be there for all my tomorrows,</em></p><p><br> <em>I came so close to sending you away,</em></p><p><br> <em>But just like you promised, you came here to stay,</em></p><p><br> <em>I just had to pray.</em></p><p><br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>And Jesus said, "Come to the water, stand by my side.</em></p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>I know you are thirsty, you won't be denied.</em></p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>I felt every tear drop when in darkness you cried,</em></p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>And I strove to remind you that for those tears I died."</em></p><p><br><br> <em>Your goodness so great I can't understand.</em></p><p><br> <em>And dear Lord, I know that all this was planned;</em></p><p><br> <em>I know you're here now and always will be.</em></p><p><br> <em>Your love loosed my chains and in You I'm free,</em></p><p><br> <em>but Jesus why me?</em></p><p><br><br> <em>Jesus, I give you my heart and my soul,</em></p><p><br> <em>I know without God, I'd never be whole.</em></p><p><br> <em>Savior, you opened all the right doors,</em></p><p><br> <em>And I thank you and praise you from earth's humble shores,</em></p><p><br> <em>Take me I'm yours.</em></p><p><br></p><center>🔹</center><p><br> i had not known it at the time, but Marsha Stevens-Pino is actually considered the mother of contemporary Christian music, because <em>For Those Tears I Died</em> was the very first contemporary Christian song!</p><p><br> and Marsha Stevens-Pino is a lesbian.</p><p><br> wow, i thought. a lesbian wrote that beautiful song?</p><p><br> my concept of lesbians was shaken.</p><p><br></p><center>🔹🟣🔹</center><p><br></p><h2>where to begin?</h2><p>Justin Lee also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGuNKz65_UM&list=PLbidsuZsGmyinfZjjBedotjOv3WPACAsA&index=2">interviewed Kathy Baldock</a> on his YouTube show, <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/geekyjustin">GeekyJustin Live</a></em>. Kathy is a heterosexual, outgoing, older white evangelical — so at first it seemed odd to me that he was interviewing her, but i soon found out that she had made her own about-face from being a completely unaffirming and traditional evangelical to writing a book, <em><a href="https://canyonwalkerconnections.com/walking-the-bridgeless-canyon-hub/">Walking the Bridgeless Canyon</a>,</em> with the express intent to “repair the breach between the Church and the LGBT community.”</p><p><br> during their lively discussion, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGuNKz65_UM&t=1262s">Justin asks Kathy</a> on behalf of a viewer: “Where would you suggest someone to start researching this academically, in addition to your books?”</p><p><br> Kathy responds by strongly recommending Justin Lee’s own book, <em><a href="https://geekyjustin.com/books/torn/">Torn</a>,</em> first and foremost, adding matter-of-factly, “and i’ve always said that.” she then goes on to recommend her own book next, and a couple of other books as well.</p><p><br> i was intrigued. because i was still so new to the topic, i felt like i was reading everything i could find, but still didn’t have a clear framework to help me pull together in my mind everything i was learning.</p><p><br> sensing God’s prompting, i decided to order <em><a href="https://geekyjustin.com/books/torn/">Torn</a></em>.</p><p><br></p><center>🔹🟣🔹</center><p><br></p><h2>clobber verses and Jesus</h2><p>Justin Lee’s book, <em><a href="https://geekyjustin.com/books/torn/">Torn</a>,</em> turned out to be an easy read. He recounts his personal story in a way that is both relatable and engaging.</p><p><br> after telling how he discovered he was gay and came out to his parents, he then turns to questions of why people are gay, conversion therapy and whether or not it works, how Christians treat gays, how gays feel about Christians, and finally, in chapters 12 and 13, what the Bible says about the issue.</p><p><br> at last we were getting to the meat of the matter!</p><p><br> apparently there are five passages in the Bible that appear to refer to homosexuality specifically (six that are known as the “clobber” verses because of the way they are so often used by thoughtless Christians on LGBTQ folks).</p><p><br> there is a story (the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah in Genesis 18:16 - 19:29) and a law (Leviticus 18:22; 20:13) from the Old Testament, and a brief discussion of idolatry and unnatural relations (Romans 1:18-32) and two lists of sins (1 Corinthians 6:9-10; 1 Timothy 1:9-10) from Paul in the New.</p><p><br> and nothing from Jesus.</p><p><br> by now i was at the point in my own walk with Jesus where i understood that His Teachings were to be prioritized above all others.</p><p><br></p><center>📖</center><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>“Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.” (Matthew 24:35, ESV)</em></p><p><br></p><center>🔹</center><p><br> everyone who says they follow Jesus will either stand or fall in the end, based on their obedience to what He has said.</p><p><br></p><center>📖</center><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>“Everyone then who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock.</em></p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>“And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock.</em></p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>“And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand.</em></p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>“And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell, and great was the fall of it.” (Matthew 7:24-27, ESV)</em></p><p><br></p><center>🔹</center><p><br> while there are some things Jesus said that were clearly meant specifically for the person (or persons) standing physically in front of Him, there are other teachings that He clearly taught as overarching principles.</p><p><br> for example, in His much-celebrated Sermon on the Mount, Jesus warns,</p><p><br></p><center>📖</center><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>“Judge not, that you be not judged. For with the judgment you pronounce you will be judged, and with the measure you use it will be measured to you.</em></p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>“Why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye? Or how can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when there is the log in your own eye?</em></p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>“You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye.” (Matthew 7:1-5, ESV)</em></p><p><br></p><center>🔹</center><p><br> and when the Pharisees decided to test Him with difficult questions, and one of them asked Him which commandment in the Law was the greatest, He replied,</p><p><br></p><center>📖</center><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>“You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the great and first commandment.</em></p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.</em></p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>“On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets.” (Matthew 22:37-40, ESV)</em></p><p><br></p><center>🔹</center><p><br> when Jesus was confronted with a woman caught in the very act of committing adultery, obeying the Law would have meant stoning her.</p><p><br> instead, He mercifully rescues her and sends her on her way.</p><p><br></p><center>📖</center><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery, and placing her in the midst they said to him, “Teacher, this woman has been caught in the act of adultery. Now in the Law, Moses commanded us to stone such women. So what do you say?”</em></p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>This they said to test him, that they might have some charge to bring against him.</em></p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Jesus bent down and wrote with his finger on the ground.</em></p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>And as they continued to ask him, he stood up and said to them, “Let him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her.”And once more he bent down and wrote on the ground.</em></p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>But when they heard it, they went away one by one, beginning with the older ones, and Jesus was left alone with the woman standing before him.</em></p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Jesus stood up and said to her, “Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?”</em></p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>She said, “No one, Lord.”</em></p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>And Jesus said, “Neither do I condemn you; go, and from now on sin no more.” (John 8:3-11, ESV)</em></p><p><br></p><center>🔹</center><p><br> as far as i can tell, the actions of some who claim to be “Christians” while attacking and mistreating LGBTQ folks, or merely trying to deny them the basic necessities of life, are in blatant and direct contradiction to the teaching and example of Jesus.</p><p><br></p><center>🔹🟣🔹</center><p><br></p><h2>what about the Bible?</h2><p>but... what about what the Bible says? if i really loved God with all my heart, soul, mind and strength, i would take His Word seriously. i couldn’t just sweep the things i’d read in the Bible under a rug. i needed to face them head on, starting with the story of Sodom and Gomorrah.</p><p><br></p><center>🔹</center><p><br></p><h3>Sodom and Gomorrah</h3><p><br> in the story of Sodom and Gomorrah, God completely destroys two cities:</p><p><br></p><center>📖</center><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Then the LORD rained on Sodom and Gomorrah sulfur and fire from the LORD out of heaven. And he overthrew those cities, and all the valley, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and what grew on the ground. (Genesis 19:24-25, ESV)</em></p><p><br></p><center>🔹</center><p><br> why? God tells Abraham:</p><p><br></p><center>📖</center><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Then the LORD said, “Because the outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is great and their sin is very grave, I will go down to see whether they have done altogether according to the outcry that has come to me. And if not, I will know.” (Genesis 18:20-21, ESV)</em></p><p><br></p><center>🔹</center><p><br> but He doesn’t say specifically what their sin is.</p><p><br> but when the angels He sends in are staying with Lot in Sodom,</p><p><br></p><center>📖</center><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>But before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, both young and old, all the people to the last man, surrounded the house. And they called to Lot, “Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us, that we may know them.” (Genesis 19:4-5, ESV)</em></p><p><br></p><center>🔹</center><p><br> to “know” them is an Old Testament euphemism for having sex, just in case you didn’t know that. so they’re basically threatening gang rape here.</p><p><br> that satisfied me. there was no need to look for any further sin to explain God’s action in this story.</p><p><br></p><center>🔹</center><p><br></p><h3>the New Testament clobber verses</h3><p><br> Paul’s lists of sins in 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 and 1 Timothy 1:9-10 specifically mentioned “homosexuality” in my modern translation of the Bible.</p><p><br> however, through my research, i learned that the English translation of the two Greek words, <em>arsenokoite</em> and <em>malakoi</em>, was controversial and unclear, and certainly not strong enough to make a sin out of something Jesus had never even mentioned. there was nothing definitive there.</p><p><br> in Romans 1, Paul talked about acts that were “unnatural” — but Paul also considered men having long hair “unnatural” as well. Samson (and others) had long hair because God told him to, so it really didn’t look to me that Paul was necessarily laying down any sort of universal principle by calling something “unnatural”.</p><p><br></p><center>🔹</center><p><br></p><h3>Leviticus</h3><p><br> so far so good... i had not found any real evidence that God considers homosexuality a sin.</p><p><br> then i got stuck at Leviticus.</p><p><br></p><center>📖</center><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>“You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination.” (Leviticus 18:22, ESV)</em></p><p><br></p><center>🔹</center><p><br> this looked pretty clear-cut to me. “abomination” sounded like something really bad.</p><p><br> i did a quick search on “abomination” in the Bible, and discovered that eating with Hebrews was an “abomination” to Egyptians, so Joseph had to eat at a separate table (Genesis 43:32). the Egyptians also for some strange reason considered shepherds an “abomination”! (Genesis 46:34)</p><p><br> that really didn’t sound so bad to me. perhaps this word “abomination” was not as absolute as i had once thought. it seemed at times to refer to cross-cultural differences...</p><p><br> then i found the following verse:</p><p><br></p><center>📖</center><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>“If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them.” (Leviticus 20:13, ESV)</em></p><p><br></p><center>🔹</center><p><br> yikes! that sounded like a much more serious kind of “abomination” — one that carried with it a death sentence!</p><p><br> plus, that law was surrounded with other laws against things like adultery, incest and bestiality!</p><p><br> Leviticus seemed like a brick wall.</p><p><br></p><center>🔹🟣🔹</center><p><br></p><h2>a test... of love</h2><p>i had come to the place where i understood that same-sex attraction was something folks were born with and not a choice at all — and therefore, not a sin, either.</p><p><br> i knew now that there are numerous Christians who are born with same-sex attraction who did not want it, who spent countless nights crying and praying to God to remove it — but He didn’t.</p><p><br> knowing these things led me to understand that God Himself must have created people with same-sex attraction for a good purpose. i couldn’t get around it; it had to be so.</p><p><br> i knew for sure that God doesn’t make mistakes; therefore, these folks must be part of His plan.</p><p><br> but what plan, exactly?</p><p><br> as i pondered more on God’s purpose in creating people with same-sex attraction, even Christians raised in denominations which condemned them, i realized that it looked like one of the reasons was that He was exposing our hearts.</p><p><br> Jesus had a serious problem with religious hypocrites back in the day (Matthew 15:1-14; Matthew 23); it wouldn’t surprise me an ounce if He still hated hypocrisy today.</p><p><br> and what better way to expose it than by creating a group of people who would appear to be sinning simply by being born?</p><p><br> through my reading i learned that the <a href="https://canyonwalkerconnections.com/forging-a-sacred-weapon-how-the-church-became-anti-gay-hub/reverend-david/">initial introduction of the word “homosexuality” into the New Testament</a> had been an error by the Revised Standard Version translation team in 1946. it was eventually corrected years later, but not before many other modern versions had followed suit.</p><p><br> had God allowed that error to occur? to test us?</p><p><br> if we are going to be followers of Jesus who also follow the Law, then first and foremost, we have to obey the two greatest commandments according to our Master and Teacher, Jesus:</p><p><br></p><center>📖</center><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>And he said to him, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the great and first commandment.</em></p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>“And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.</em></p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets.” (Matthew 22:37-40, ESV)</em></p><p><br></p><center>🔹</center><p><br> they obviously take precedence over all other laws — including the one in Leviticus 18:22.</p><p><br> i had always wondered how it could be possible that people who are filled with the Holy Spirit, casting out demons, doing miracles, and more, could be called “workers of lawlessness” by Jesus, and told, “i never knew you.”</p><p><br></p><center>📖</center><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>“Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.</em></p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>“On that day many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?’</em></p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>“And then will I declare to them, ‘I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.’”(Matthew 7:21-23, ESV)</em></p><p><br></p><center>🔹</center><p><br> now i was sure i had my answer.</p><p><br></p><center>🔹🟣🔹</center><p><br></p><h2>repent</h2><p>there is so much more that could be said on this topic. and so much more that has been wonderfully well communicated by others — in books, on websites, through videos... and more.</p><p><br> i’ve only told the story of how i became convinced that God is not at all against LGBTQ folks — not anymore than He is against anyone else, regardless of sexuality.</p><p><br> in fact, i’m convinced that He created them for a good purpose — to show us what is in our hearts.</p><p><br> is God still against sin? undoubtedly. but being born with same-sex attraction is not a sin, since it is not a choice. and in rejecting such folks, or denying them equal treatment before the law, we are breaking the second greatest commandment: to love our neighbour as we love ourselves (Matthew 22:37-40). we are actually running the risk of being rejected ourselves when Jesus comes again (Matthew 7:21-23).</p><p><br> so if you are one of those folks who believes they must reject anyone who says they are LGBTQ in order to follow Jesus — please, reconsider. remember Jesus’ teachings and His example, and repent.</p><p><br></p><center>🔹🟣🔹</center><p><br></p><h2>what about same-sex marriage?</h2><p>what about same-sex marriage? isn’t that in direct contradiction to the law in Leviticus — that brick wall i was unable to go through?</p><p><br> some Christians agree that there is absolutely nothing wrong with being born with same-sex attraction. but because of the law in Leviticus 18:22, they believe all folks experiencing same-sex attraction must either marry a member of the opposite sex, or remain celibate.</p><p><br> i have honestly come to the place where i do not have any problem with same-sex marriage. of course, not everyone will agree with me, and i respect that. but i do not believe that a loving, committed, monogamous same-sex relationship is offensive to God any more than a similar opposite-sex one is. why??</p><p><br> some LGBTQ Christians believe they are called to celibacy; others are already in loving, committed, monogamous same-sex relationships. at Creation, God said it wasn’t good for the man to be alone (Genesis 2:18). Jesus said not everyone could handle being celibate (Matthew 19:10-12), and Paul said it is better to marry than to burn with passion (1 Corinthians 7:8-9).</p><p><br> i believe that the loving thing to do is to allow each person to decide for themselves whether or not they can be celibate. and if they decide to marry, even if you personally do not like their choice of spouse, respect their choice and embrace them both.</p><p><br> some commentators have said that the Leviticus law was referring not to loving, committed, monogamous same-sex relationships but to the <a href="https://medium.com/colloquium/wartime-sexual-violence-against-men-21ae5b15b3c">ancient practice of heterosexual warriors raping enemy combatants</a> in order to subjugate and humiliate them — because loving, committed monogamous same-sex relationships didn’t exist back then.</p><p><br> similarly, apparently the ancient cultural practice to which Paul may have been referring (which was mistakenly translated into the modern word “homosexuality”) in his lists of sins, was pederasty — a practice in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality_in_ancient_Greece">Greek</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality_in_ancient_Rome">Roman</a> culture in which older men married to women would also take a younger male lover whom they would mentor — i.e., a form of adultery.</p><p><br> then there is the extremely serious modern-day problem of some “celibate” Catholic priests sexually abusing youth under their care. clearly, it must be wrong and unloving and just a really bad idea to coerce anyone into celibacy.</p><p><br> so celibacy has to be a personal choice, just as Jesus said.</p><p><br></p><center>📖</center><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>The disciples said to him, “If such is the case of a man with his wife, it is better not to marry.”</em></p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>But he said to them, “Not everyone can receive this saying, but only those to whom it is given.

I will betroth you to me in righteousness and in justice, in steadfast love and in mercy. I will betroth you to me in faithfulness.</em></p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>And you shall know the LORD.” (Hosea 2:18b-20, ESV)</em></p></div><span>Tagged with: </span><ul class="tag-list"></ul></article></div><footer><p>🌐 <a href="https://truthaboutjesus-github-io.translate.goog/?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp">Translate this website with Google</a></p><p>🌐 <a href="https://truthaboutjesus-github-io.translate.goog/?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp">用谷歌翻譯這個網站</a></p><p>Generated using 使用生成的 <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a></p><p><a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed 提要</a></p></footer></body></html>
