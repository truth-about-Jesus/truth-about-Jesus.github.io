He loves you so much that He even laid down His life for you.</p><p><br> <em>John 10:11-18 (TCENT)</em></p><p>11 I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.</p><p>12 But the hired hand is not the shepherd and does not own the sheep. So when he sees the wolf coming, he leaves the sheep and flees, and the wolf snatches the sheep and scatters them.</p><p>13 The hired hand flees, for he is a hired hand and does not care about the sheep.</p><p>14 I am the good shepherd. I know my sheep and my sheep know me,</p><p>15 even as the Father knows me, and I know the Father. I lay down my life for the sheep.</p><p>16 I have other sheep that are not of this fold. I must bring them also, and they will hear my voice. And there will be one flock, one shepherd.</p><p>17 This is why the Father loves me, because I lay down my life so that I may take it up again.</p><p>18 No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it up again. I received this commandment from my Father.”</p><p><br><br></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://your-website-url.com/posts/exhausted</guid><title>exhausted</title><description>i feel exhausted from working too hard.</description><link>https://your-website-url.com/posts/exhausted</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 May 2023 10:45:00 -0400</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>exhausted</h1><p><br> Jesus understands and sees you. He says:</p><p><br> <em>Matthew 11:28-30 (TCENT)</em></p><p>28 "Come to me, all of you who labor and are burdened, and I will give you rest.</p><p>29 Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.</p><p>30 For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.”</p><p><br><br> He knows what it is like to feel tired.</p><p><br> <em>John 4:6 (TCENT)</em></p><p>6 Jacob's well was there, so Jesus, wearied as he was from the journey, sat by the well. It was about the sixth hour.</p><p><br><br> He knows what it is like to feel abandoned by God.</p><p><br> <em>Mark 15:34 (TCENT)</em></p><p>34 And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, “Eloi, Eloi, lima sabachthani?” which means, “My God, my God, why have yoʋ forsaken me?”</p><p><br><br> Jesus came to make your life the best it can possibly be.</p><p><br> <em>John 10:9-10 (TCENT)</em></p><p>9 "I am the gate; if anyone enters through me, he will be saved and will come in and go out and find pasture.</p><p>10 The thief comes only to steal, kill, and destroy. I have come that they may have life, and have it abundantly."</p><p><br><br> Would you like to partner with Jesus, doing things that matter for all eternity and not just for this life?</p><p><br> <em>John 6:27-29 (TCENT)</em></p><p>27 "Do not work for food that perishes, but for food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. For on him God the Father has set his seal.”</p><p>28 Then they said to him, “What must we do to do the works of God?”</p><p>29 Jesus answered them, “This is the work of God, that you believe in the one he has sent.”</p><p><br><br> Following Jesus isn't easy, but it's worth everything you could ever gain in this life.</p><p><br> <em>Mark 8:34-37 (TCENT)</em></p><p>34 Then he called the crowd over, along with his disciples, and said to them, “If anyone wants to follow me, he must deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me.</p><p>35 For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake and for the sake of the gospel will save it.</p><p>36 For what will it benefit a person if he gains the whole world but forfeits his soul?</p><p>37 Or what can a person give in exchange for his soul?</p><p><br><br> He is physically away right now, but one day He will return, and everyone on earth will see Him.</p><p><br> <em>Matthew 24:23-27 (TCENT)</em></p><p>23 If anyone says to you at that time, ‘Behold, here is the Christ!’ or, ‘Here he is!’ do not believe him.</p><p>24 For false christs and false prophets will rise up and perform great signs and wonders so as to lead astray, if possible, even the chosen.</p><p>25 Behold, I have told you in advance.</p><p>26 So if they say to you, ‘Behold, he is in the wilderness,’ do not go out, or, ‘Behold, he is in the inner rooms,’ do not believe it.</p><p>27 For just as lightning comes from the east and shines to the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.</p><p><br><br> When He comes, He will gather all those who belong to Him and take them home.</p><p><br> <em>Matthew 24:29-31 (TCENT)</em></p><p>29 “But immediately after the tribulation of those days, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light. The stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.</p><p>30 Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the heavens, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn when they see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.</p><p>31 And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather together his chosen from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other.</p><p><br><br> Would you like to go home to Heaven with Jesus when He comes back?</p><p><br> i know i would!</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
