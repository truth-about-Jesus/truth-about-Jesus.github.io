Mary has chosen the good portion, which will not be taken away from her.” (Luke 10:41-42, ESV)</em></p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>“但主回答說：「馬大，馬大，你為許多的事，思慮煩擾， 但是不可少的只有一件。馬利亞已經選擇那最好的，是不能拿走的。」” (Luke 10:41-42, Chinese NET (T))</em></p><p><br><br></p><center>🔹</center><p><br><br> finally, almost nothing social remained on our calendar, except church on Sundays. my hubby Henry and son Jared and i were attending a small church not far from our home fairly regularly, although we had not really gotten to know anyone there as yet. i guess i was still hoping i might eventually get involved with the worship team or some other form of ministry there, since that was how i’d grown up — actively serving in the church. but it was becoming more and more clear that God had other plans for me that were outside of my expectations.</p><p><br> 最後，除了週日的教堂外，我們的日曆上幾乎沒有任何社交活動。我的丈夫亨利和兒子賈裡德和我經常去離我們家不遠的一個小教堂，儘管我們還沒有真正認識那裡的任何人。我想我仍然希望我最終能參與那裡的禮拜團隊或其他形式的事工，因為我就是這樣長大的——在教堂裡積極服務。但越來越清楚的是，上帝對我還有其他超出我預期的計劃。</p><p><br><br> on December 15th, 2019 we attended what turned out to be our last service at that church together as a family. that day we were creating Christmas tree ornaments with balloons, jute and glue, sitting around large round tables with others in the congregation. because our ornaments were still wet, we had to leave them hanging up to dry.</p><p><br> 2019年12月15日，我們一家人一起參加了那座教堂的最後一次禮拜儀式。那天，我們用氣球、黃麻和膠水製作聖誕樹裝飾品，與會眾中的其他人圍坐在大圓桌旁。因為我們的裝飾品仍然溼漉漉的，我們不得不把它們掛起來晾乾。</p><p><br><br> the rest of the church was going to stay for lunch, but we had other plans. Henry and Jared went out to the car while i was waylaid by one of the women inviting me to join the lunch. i explained to her that my hubby and son were waiting for me, and she graciously let me go.</p><p><br> 教堂的其他人打算留下來吃午飯，但我們有其他計劃。 亨利和賈裡德走到車上，當時我被一個邀請我參加午餐的女人擋住了。我向她解釋說，我的丈夫和兒子在等我，她慷慨地讓我走了。</p><p><br><br> all that next week, i was down with the flu. i finally got better for a week, then came down with another flu for a third week. by that time we had missed all of the remaining Sunday church services in 2019.</p><p><br> 下週，我得了流感。我終於好轉了一週，然後又得了流感第三週。到那時，我們已經錯過了2019年剩下的所有週日教堂禮拜。</p><p><br><br> around that time, God started to speak to me from His Word about going out to the wilderness. i didn’t really understand — not yet. but i’ve noticed He tends to get the ball rolling in telling me things i don’t understand or pick up on right away, so that later when i finally do get the message, i can look back through my journal and realize that He had been speaking to me about that for a while.</p><p><br> 大約在那個時候，上帝開始從他的話語中對我說關於去荒野的事情。我真的不明白——還沒有。但我注意到他傾向於開始告訴我我不明白的事情，或者馬上開始，這樣以後當我終於收到資訊時，我可以回顧我的日記，意識到他已經和我談了一段時間了。</p><p><br><br></p><center>📖</center><p><br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>But the woman was given the two wings of the great eagle so that she might fly from the serpent into the wilderness, to the place where she is to be nourished for a time, and times, and half a time. (Revelation 12:14, ESV)</em></p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>“但是有大鷹的兩個翅膀賜給婦人，叫她能飛到曠野，到 神為她預備的地方躲避那蛇，她在那裏被照顧一載二載半載。” (Revelation 12:14, Chinese NET (T))</em></p><p><br><br></p><center>🔹</center><p><br> i struggled with this calling to the wilderness over and over and over again. every time i asked God for confirmation, He graciously gave it. every time someone invited me to something and i felt bad once again for not being there, and i asked Him yet again whether it was really from Him, God kindly gave me another word about being in the wilderness, until there could be no question anymore.</p><p><br> 我一遍又一遍地與這個對曠野的召喚作鬥爭。每次我向上帝請求確認時，他都慷慨地給了我。每次有人邀請我參加某事，我再次為不在那裡而感到難過，我再次問他這是否真的來自他，上帝親切地又給了我一句關於在曠野的話，直到不再有疑問。</p><p><br><br></p><center>📖</center><p><br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>And the child grew and became strong in spirit, and he was in the wilderness until the day of his public appearance to Israel. (Luke 1:80, ESV)</em></p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>“那孩子漸漸長大，靈裏壯健，住在曠野，直到他被啟示給以色列的日子。” (Luke 1:80, Chinese NET (T))</em></p><p><br><br></p><center>🔹🟣🔹</center><p><br><br></p><h2>wait — what?! &nbsp;&nbsp;等等——什麼？！</h2><p>while i was down with my first week of flu, the church sent out their usual weekly announcement email, and one item in particular caught me by surprise.</p><p><br> 當我患有流感的第一週時，教會傳送了他們通常的每週公告電子郵件，其中特別讓我措手不及。</p><p><br><br> it was the screening of a video of two women getting married — to each other! i felt very troubled and concerned.</p><p><br> 這是放映兩個女人結婚的影片——彼此！ 我感到非常煩惱和擔憂。</p><p><br><br> up until that moment, i had not realized that this church, which God had clearly been leading us to attend for the past five months, was pro-LGBTQ.</p><p><br> 直到那一刻，我才意識到這個上帝在過去五個月裡顯然一直引導我們參加的教會是親LGBTQ的。</p><p><br><br> i didn’t have much experience or knowledge about anything LGBTQ-related. my best friend Drew in grade school had turned out to be gay, apparently, but we had drifted apart after grade 5, and i had only found out from someone else after we had both already graduated from high school and lost contact.</p><p><br> 我對任何與LGBTQ有關的事情都沒有太多經驗或知識。顯然，我小學時最好的朋友Drew原來是同性戀，但我們在五年級後就疏遠了，我只是在高中畢業並失去聯絡後才從別人那裡發現。</p><p><br><br> then there had been no personal contact with anyone LGBTQ — at least, not that i was aware of — until my beginner women’s ice hockey team only a few years ago: at least three women on my team had been lesbians. one was our coach; the other two, i eventually found out, were married to each other. they were the kindest, most trustworthy members of our team, as far as i could tell.</p><p><br> 然後，直到幾年前我的初學者女子冰球隊才與任何LGBTQ沒有任何個人接觸——至少，我不知道——我的團隊中至少有三個女性是女同性戀者。一個是我們的教練；另外兩個，我最終發現，彼此結婚了。據我所知，她們是我們團隊中最善良、最值得信賴的成員。</p><p><br><br> but through my times of reading through the Bible, i had occasionally come across that word “homosexuality” — and not in any positive sense. it was always in one of Paul’s lists of sins. so i honestly thought the Bible was pretty clear about such matters. i also assumed the reason God had destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah was because they were all homosexuals...</p><p><br> 但在我閱讀《聖經》的時候，我偶爾會遇到“同性戀”這個詞——而且沒有任何積極的意義上。它總是在保羅的罪孽清單中。所以我誠實地認為《聖經》對這些問題非常清楚。我還認為上帝摧毀所多瑪和蛾摩拉的原因是因為他們都是同性戀者......</p><p><br><br> then there was the local Pride Parade, which i had sometimes seen televised: folks dressed flamboyantly and sometimes rather skimpily...</p><p><br> 然後是當地的驕傲遊行，我有時看過電視轉播：人們穿著華麗，有時相當吝嗇......</p><p><br><br> and the news headlines — back during the beginning of the AIDS crisis, every so often some preacher would make headlines condemning gays and using the epidemic to prove that God was judging them.</p><p><br> 和新聞頭條新聞——早在艾滋病危機開始時，一些傳教士經常會成為譴責同性戀的頭條新聞，並利用疫情來證明上帝在審判他們。</p><p><br><br> and then there was the issue of legalizing gay marriage: it seemed to me that most prominent, well-respected Christian leaders, like Billy Graham and James Dobson, were all against it.</p><p><br> 然後是同性戀婚姻合法化的問題：在我看來，最傑出、最受尊敬的基督教領袖，如比利·格雷厄姆和詹姆斯·多布森，都反對它。</p><p><br><br> and more recently i had seen a headline about lesbians trying to drive a Christian baker out of business because he had refused to make their wedding cake...</p><p><br> 最近，我看到一個關於女同性戀者試圖趕走一個基督教麵包師的頭條新聞，因為他拒絕做他們的婚禮蛋糕......</p><p><br><br> so even though my two personal encounters with LGBTQ folks were overwhelmingly positive, what i read in the Bible and saw in the news and on TV was quite negative.</p><p><br> 因此，儘管我與LGBTQ人群的兩次個人接觸是絕對積極的，但我在聖經中讀到並在新聞和電視上看到的東西是相當消極的。</p><p><br><br> so... why did it seem like this church was actually promoting gay marriage?!</p><p><br> 所以......為什麼這個教會似乎真的在提倡同性戀婚姻？！</p><p><br><br></p><center>🔹🟣🔹</center><p><br><br></p><h2>“you can learn something”</h2><h2>“你可以學到一些東西”</h2><p>while i was still recovering from my first bout of the flu in December 2019, i had difficulty sleeping because of a lingering cough. in the early morning hours of the 23rd, i had a dream in which i saw links to two LGBTQ websites. when i pulled something from them, i discovered i could sleep better without coughing.</p><p><br> 當我還在從2019年12月的第一次流感中恢復過來時，由於持續的咳嗽，我難以入睡。在23日凌晨，我做了一個夢，看到了兩個LGBTQ網站的連結。當我從他們那裡拿出一些東西時，我發現我可以睡得更好，不咳嗽。</p><p><br><br> it seemed to me from this dream that Jesus was saying to me, “Enid, you can learn something from LGBTQ folks.” then He gave me this thought-provoking verse:</p><p><br> 在我看來，從這個夢中，耶穌對我說：“Enid，你可以從LGBTQ人那裡學到一些東西。”然後他給了我這首發人深省的詩：</p><p><br><br></p><center>📖</center><p><br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>“My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge; because you have rejected knowledge, I reject you from being a priest to me. And since you have forgotten the law of your God, I also will forget your children.” (Hosea 4:6, ESV)</em></p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>““我的百姓因缺乏知識而被毀滅；因為你拒絕了知識，我拒絕你成為我的祭司。 既然你忘記了你上帝的律法，我也會忘記你的孩子。” （霍西阿 4:6, 翻譯自 ESV)</em></p><p><br><br></p><center>🔹</center><p><br><br> i was definitely getting the impression that Jesus was calling me out for my ignorance of the whole LGBTQ question! still, i was reluctant to expose myself to something that could possibly be a snare to me...</p><p><br> 我絕對得到的印象是，耶穌在呼喚我，因為我對整個LGBTQ問題的無知！ 儘管如此，我仍然不願意讓自己暴露在可能成為我陷阱的東西中......</p><p><br><br> whenever we saw same-sex attraction portrayed on TV — usually a kiss between two women or two men — i would look away. my husband thought i was looking away because i was disgusted by sin, but in reality i was looking away because i was trying to avoid being tempted myself... a subtle but real difference.</p><p><br> 每當我們看到電視上描繪的同性吸引力——通常是兩個女人或兩個男人之間的親吻——我都會把目光移開。我丈夫認為我在把目光移開，因為我對罪惡感到厭惡，但實際上我把目光移開，因為我試圖避免自己受到誘惑......一種微妙但真正的區別。</p><p><br><br> i felt there might be some temptation there. i had a vague notion — perhaps i’d heard it somewhere — that people became gay because of, well, parental failures. i definitely had experienced what i considered fairly serious “parental failures” growing up, so i thought it prudent to keep away from such temptations at all costs, as i thought i might be particularly susceptible.</p><p><br> 我覺得那裡可能有一些誘惑。我有一個模糊的概念——也許我在某個地方聽說過——人們因為父母的失敗而成為同性戀。我肯定經歷過我認為相當嚴重的“父母失敗”的成長，所以我認為不惜一切代價遠離這種誘惑是謹慎的，因為我認為我可能特別容易受到影響。</p><p><br><br> and i remembered when Wendy Gritter of New Direction, a Christian ministry reaching out to gays, had spoken at our church some 20-plus years ago. she had said that she had gay friends who wanted her to consider their alternative interpretation of Scripture as accepting of LGBTQ folks, but did not go into any actual detail. since it seemed to me that the Bible was unmistakably clear on this matter, i had assumed that whatever they had to say must be some kind of insidious deception that i should definitely avoid.</p><p><br> 我記得大約20多年前，基督教事工New Direction的Wendy Gritter在我們的教堂發表了講話。她說，她有同性戀朋友希望她考慮他們對聖經的替代解釋是接受LGBTQ人群，但沒有詳細說明。由於在我看來，《聖經》在這件事上明確無誤地清楚了，我以為無論他們說什麼，都一定是某種我絕對應該避免的陰險欺騙。</p><p><br><br> so my whole approach to anything LGBTQ was pretty simple: avoidance.</p><p><br> 因此，我對任何LGBTQ的整個方法都很簡單：迴避。</p><p><br><br> but now it looked like Jesus didn’t want me to avoid the issue any longer! okay, yeah, probably i could learn something from LGBTQ folks. it seemed to me i could learn something from anyone — if i tried hard enough! but — didn’t the dangers far outweigh the benefits?! how could Jesus ask this of me?!</p><p><br> 但現在看起來耶穌不想讓我再迴避這個問題了！ 好吧，是的，也許我可以從LGBTQ人群那裡學到一些東西。在我看來，如果我足夠努力的話，我可以從任何人那裡學到一些東西！ 但是——危險不是遠遠超過了好處嗎？！ 耶穌怎麼會這樣問我？！</p><p><br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>“my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge...”</em></p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>“我的人民因為缺乏知識而被摧毀......"</em></p><p><br><br> as i puzzled over this apparent contradiction, suddenly a question popped into my mind: “what if Jared is gay?” (Jared is my son.)</p><p><br> 當我對這個明顯的矛盾感到困惑時，我突然想到了一個問題：“如果Jared是同性戀呢？” （Jared是我兒子。）</p><p><br><br> i was instantly highly motivated.</p><p><br> 我立刻有了很高的動力。</p><p><br></p><center>🧩</center><p><br><br> <em>(i held out for as long as i could, but eventually, when the opportunity arose — i don’t exactly remember how — i did ask Jared, a little nervously, and he assured me unequivocally that he was straight.)</em></p><p><br> <em>（我儘可能地堅持了下來，但最終，當機會出現時——我不太記得是怎麼做的——我確實有點緊張地問了Jared，他毫不含糊地向我保證他是直的。）</em></p><p><br><br></p><center>🔹🟣🔹</center><p><br><br></p><h2>a living apology &nbsp;&nbsp;活生生的道歉</h2><p>since the only person i had ever heard of being involved in Christian ministry to gays was Wendy Gritter, i did a search for her on the internet.</p><p><br> 由於我唯一聽說過參與基督教同性戀事工的人是Wendy Gritter，我在網際網路上搜尋了她。</p><p><br><br> i discovered that her organization, New Direction, had morphed into something else entirely, called “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200810153420/https://www.generousspace.ca/our-history">Generous Space</a>". there was a “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200810154839/https://www.generousspace.ca/living-apology">living apology</a>” on their website for something called “ex-gay” ministry, which, as i read further, turned out to be well-meaning but apparently misguided attempts on the part of Christians to help gays divest themselves of same-sex attraction — i.e., conversion therapy.</p><p><br> 我發現她的組織“新方向”已經完全演變成其他東西，稱為“<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200810153420/https://www.generousspace.ca/our-history">慷慨的空間</a>”。他們的網站上有一個“<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200810154839/https://www.generousspace.ca/living-apology">活生生的道歉</a>”，用於所謂的“前同性戀”事工，正如我進一步閱讀的那樣，這原來是善意但顯然是基督徒幫助同性戀者擺脫同性吸引力的企圖——即皈依療法。</p><p><br><br> really?
