John 1:1-3,14 (ESV)

1 In the beginning was the Word, 

and the Word was with God, 

and the Word was God.

2 He was in the beginning with God.

John 1:1-3,14 (Chinese NET (T))

1 太初有道，道與 神同在，道就是 神。

2 這道在太初就與 神同在。

\

3 All things were made through him, 

and without him was not any thing made that was made.

3 萬物都是藉着他造的；

凡被造的，沒有一樣不是藉着他造的。

\

14 And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, 

and we have seen his glory,

glory as of the only Son from the Father, 
full of grace and truth.

14 道成了肉身，住在我們中間，

充充滿滿的有恩典有真理。

我們見過他的榮光，正是父獨生子的榮光。

\

John 1:18 (NIV)

18 No one has ever seen God, 

but the one and only Son, 

who is himself God 

and is in closest relationship with the Father, 

has made him known.

John 1:18 (Chinese NET (T))

18 從來沒有人見過 神，

只有與父最親近的獨生子將 神表明出來。
