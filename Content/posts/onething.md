When faced with two sisters who responded to Him in two different ways, resulting in conflict, Jesus explained which way was better.

當面對兩個以兩種不同方式迴應他的姐妹，導致衝突時，耶穌解釋了哪種方式更好。

\

##### _Luke 10:38-42 (ESV)_

38 Now as they went on their way, Jesus entered a village. And a woman named Martha welcomed him into her house.

39 And she had a sister called Mary, who sat at the Lord's feet and listened to his teaching.

\

40 But Martha was distracted with much serving. And she went up to him and said, “Lord, do you not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? Tell her then to help me.”

\

41 But the Lord answered her, “Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things,

42 but one thing is necessary. Mary has chosen the good portion, which will not be taken away from her.”

\

##### _Luke 10:38-42 (Chinese NET (T))_

38 他們前行的時候，耶穌進了一個村莊，有一個女人名叫馬大，接待他到自己家裏。

39 她有一個妹子名叫馬利亞，在耶穌腳前坐着聽他的話。

\

40 馬大伺候的事多，心裏忙亂，就進前來說：「主啊，我的妹子留下我一個人伺候，你不在意嗎？請吩咐她來幫助我。」

\

41 但主回答說：「馬大，馬大，你為許多的事，思慮煩擾，

42 但是不可少的只有一件。馬利亞已經選擇那最好的，是不能拿走的。」

\

Sitting at Jesus' feet and listening to His teaching is the one necessary thing.

坐在耶穌的腳下，聆聽他的教導是一件必要的事情。

How can we do this today, since Jesus has already gone back to Heaven?

既然耶穌已經回到了天堂，我們今天怎麼能做到這一點？

\

Even though we cannot see or hear Jesus physically today, His words are recorded in the Gospels.

儘管我們今天無法在身體上看到或聽到耶穌，但他的話被記錄在福音書中。

\

We can sit at His feet and listen to Him like Mary did, by reading His words in the Gospels of [Matthew](https://www.stepbible.org/?q=version=NIV|reference=Matt.1&options=LVHXGU), [Mark](https://www.stepbible.org/?q=version=NIV|reference=Mark.1&options=LVHXGU), [Luke](https://www.stepbible.org/?q=version=NIV|reference=Luke.1&options=LVHXGU) and [John](https://www.stepbible.org/?q=version=NIV|reference=John.1&options=LVHXGU).

我們可以坐在他的腳下，像馬利亞一樣，透過閱讀他在[馬太福音](https://www.stepbible.org/?q=version=ChiNCVt|reference=Matt.1&options=LVHXGU)、[馬可福音](https://www.stepbible.org/?q=version=ChiNCVt|reference=Mark.1&options=LVHXGU)、[路加福音](https://www.stepbible.org/?q=version=ChiNCVt|reference=Luke.1&options=LVHXGU)和[約翰福音](https://www.stepbible.org/?q=version=ChiNCVt|reference=John.1&options=LVHXGU)中的話來聽他說話。
