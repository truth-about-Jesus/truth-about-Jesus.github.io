Jesus warned us ahead of time about all these problems:

耶穌提前警告我們所有這些問題：

\

##### _Matthew 24:6-8 (TCENT)_

###### \

6 “You will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not alarmed, for all these things must take place, but the end is not yet. 

7 For nation will rise up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines, plagues, and earthquakes in various places.

8 But all these things are the beginning of the labor pains.”

\

##### _Matthew 24:6-8 (Chinese NET (T))_

###### \

6 你們會聽見打仗和打仗的謠言，但不要驚慌，因為這些事是必須有的，只是末日還沒有到。

7 民要攻打民，國要攻打國，多處必有饑荒和地震。

8 這都是產難的起頭。」

\

He even says things will get much worse!

他甚至說事情會變得更糟！

\

##### _Luke 21:25-26 (TCENT)_

###### \

25 “There will be signs in the sun, moon, and stars, and on the earth there will be distress among the nations as they are perplexed by the roaring sea and the surging waves.

26 People will faint from fear and foreboding of what is coming upon the world, for the powers of the heavens will be shaken.”

\

##### _Luke 21:25-26 (Chinese NET (T))_

###### \

25 「日月星辰要顯出異兆，地上的邦國必有困苦，因海的聲音和浪的澎湃，就驚慌不定。

26 天勢都要震動，人想起那將要臨到世界的事，就都嚇得魂不附體。」

\

\
\

but at the end of it all, He will come back to take His children home.

但最終，他會回來並帶自己的孩子回家。

\

##### _Luke 21:27-28 (TCENT)_

###### \

27 “Then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.

28 So when these things begin to take place, stand tall and lift up your heads, for your redemption is near.”

\

##### _Luke 21:27-28 (Chinese NET (T))_

###### \

27 那時，他們要看見人子帶着能力和大榮耀駕雲降臨。

28 一有這些事，你們就當挺身昂首；因為你們得贖的日子近了。」

\

\
\

it is tempting in times like these, while waiting for Jesus to come take us home, to try to escape our worries and fears by getting caught up in various distractions, but Jesus warns us against mere escapism:

在這樣的時刻，在等待耶穌帶我們回家時，試圖透過陷入各種分心來逃避我們的擔憂和恐懼，這很誘人，但耶穌警告我們不要單純的逃避：

\

##### _Luke 21:34-36 (TCENT)_

###### \

34 “Watch yourselves, lest your hearts be weighed down with carousing, drunkenness, and the cares of this life, and that day come upon you suddenly.

35 For it will come like a trap upon all who dwell on the face of the whole earth.

36 Therefore stay alert at all times, praying that you may be considered worthy to escape everything that will take place, and to stand before the Son of Man.”

\

##### _Luke 21:34-36 (Chinese NET (T))_

###### \


34 「你們要謹慎，不要被縱情醉酒並今生的思慮累住你們的心，而由得那日子如同網羅忽然臨到你們，

35 因為那日子要臨到全地上一切居住的人。

36 你們要時時儆醒，常常祈求，使你們能得力逃避這一切必要來的事，又得以站立在人子面前。」

\
\

in fact, Jesus reassures us that we don't need to worry or be afraid at all because God is our Father who knows and cares for our needs. 

事實上，耶穌向我們保證，我們根本不需要擔心或害怕，因為上帝是我們的父親，他知道並關心我們的需求。

\

##### _Matthew 6:25-32 (GNB)_

###### \

25 "This is why I tell you: do not be worried about the food and drink you need in order to stay alive, or about clothes for your body. After all, isn't life worth more than food? And isn't the body worth more than clothes?

26 Look at the birds: they do not plant seeds, gather a harvest and put it in barns; yet your Father in heaven takes care of them! Aren't you worth much more than birds?

27 Can any of you live a bit longer by worrying about it?

\

28 "And why worry about clothes? Look how the wild flowers grow: they do not work or make clothes for themselves.

29 But I tell you that not even King Solomon with all his wealth had clothes as beautiful as one of these flowers.

30 It is God who clothes the wild grass—grass that is here today and gone tomorrow, burned up in the oven. Won't he be all the more sure to clothe you? What little faith you have!

\

31 "So do not start worrying: 'Where will my food come from? or my drink? or my clothes?'

32 (These are the things the pagans are always concerned about.) Your Father in heaven knows that you need all these things.

\

##### _Matthew 6:25-32 (Chinese NET (T))_

###### \

25 「所以我告訴你們，不要為生命憂慮吃甚麼、喝甚麼，或為身體憂慮穿甚麼。生命不重於飲食嗎？身體不重於衣裳嗎？

26 你們看那天上的飛鳥，牠們也不種、也不收、也不積蓄在倉裏，你們的天父尚且養活牠們，你們不比飛鳥貴重得多嗎？

27 你們那一個能用思慮使壽數多加一小時呢？

\

28 何必為衣裳憂慮呢？試想野地裏的花朵怎麼長起來，它們也不工作、也不紡線，

29 然而我告訴你們，就是所羅門極榮華的時候，他所穿著的還比不上這花的一朵呢！

30 你們這小信的人哪！地裏的野草，今天還在，明天就被丟在爐裏， 神還給它這樣的妝飾，何況你們呢？

\

31 所以不要憂慮，說：『吃甚麼？喝甚麼？穿甚麼？』

32 這些都是不信的人所追求的，但你們的天父知道你們的需要。

\

in these verses Jesus speaks specifically of food and clothing, but we can expect that God, our loving Heavenly Father, will take care of all our needs, including a safe place to live, breathe and grow. 

在這些經文中，耶穌特別談到了食物和衣服，但我們可以期望，上帝，我們慈愛的天父，將照顧我們所有的需求，包括一個安全的生活、呼吸和成長的地方。

\

\
\

but then why are so many in trouble and need at this time?

但是，為什麼這個時候有這麼多人陷入困境和需要？

\

perhaps this is the key: Jesus commands us to spend our time not chasing after the things we need, nor trying to escape through distractions, but doing something far more essential and productive:

也許這就是關鍵：耶穌命令我們花時間不要追逐我們需要的東西，也不要試圖透過分心來逃避，而是做一些更重要和更有成效的事情：

\

##### _Matthew 6:33 (ESV)_

###### \

33 But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.

\

##### _Matthew 6:33 (Chinese NET (T))_

###### \

33 你們要先求他的國和他的義，這一切東西也會給你們了。

\

as we do so, we will be taken care of on a daily basis, and we will not need to be afraid. 

當我們這樣做時，我們將每天得到照顧，我們不需要害怕。

\

##### _Matthew 6:34 (NET)_

###### \

34 So then, do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Today has enough trouble of its own.

\

##### _Matthew 6:34 (Chinese NET (T))_

###### \

34 所以不要為明天憂慮，因為明天自有明天的憂慮，今天的難處也夠受了。

\

but -- how exactly do we "seek first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness"?

但是——我們究竟如何“首先尋求上帝的國度和他的公義”？

\

we can start here: [would you like to belong to God's family?](/posts/family)

我們可以從這裡開始：[你想屬於上帝的家庭嗎?](/posts/family)

Jesus strongly encouraged His followers to remain in His word:

耶穌強烈鼓勵他的追隨者堅持他的話：

\

##### _John 8:31-32 (TCENT)_

###### \

31 Then Jesus said to the Jews who had believed in him, “If you abide in my word, you are truly my disciples.

32 Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”

\

##### _John 8:31-32 (Chinese NET (T))_

###### \

31 耶穌對信他的猶太人說：「你們若繼續遵守我的道，就真是我的門徒。

32 你們必曉得真理，真理必叫你們得以自由。」

\

Jesus’ words will still be in force when everything else has been destroyed. He said:

當其他一切都被摧毀時，耶穌的話仍然有效。 他說：

\

##### _Luke 21:33 (TCENT)_

###### \

33 “Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will certainly not pass away.”

\

##### _Luke 21:33 (Chinese NET (T))_

###### \

33 天地都要廢去，我的話卻永不會廢去。

\

<center>💠</center>

\
\

##### _Revelation 21:1-8 (ESV)_

###### \

1 Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea was no more.

\

2 And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.

\

3 And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, “Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God.

4 He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.”

\

5 And he who was seated on the throne said, “Behold, I am making all things new.” Also he said, “Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true.”

\

6 And he said to me, “It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. To the thirsty I will give from the spring of the water of life without payment.

7 The one who conquers will have this heritage, and I will be his God and he will be my son.

\

8 But as for the cowardly, the faithless, the detestable, as for murderers, the sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars, their portion will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death.”

\

##### _Revelation 21:1-8 (Chinese NET (T))_

###### \

1 然後，我看見一個新天新地，因為第一個天地不再存在了，海也不再有了。

\

2 我又看見聖城新耶路撒冷由 神那裏從天而降，預備好了，就如新婦裝飾整齊，等候丈夫。

\

3 我聽見有一個大聲音從寶座出來說：「看哪！ 神的居所在人間，他要與人同住。他們要作他的子民， 神要親自與他們同在。

4 神要擦去他們每一滴眼淚，不再有死亡、哀悼、哭號、疼痛，因為以前的事都不存在了。」

\

5 坐寶座的說：「看哪！我將一切都新造了。」然後對我說：「你要寫上，因這些話是可信的，是真實的。」

\

6 他又對我說：「都成了。我是阿拉法，我是俄梅戛，我是始，我是終。我要將生命泉的水白白賜給那口渴的人喝。

7 克服的必承受這些為業，我要作他的 神，他要作我的兒子。

\

8 惟有懦弱的、不信的、可憎的、殺人的、淫亂的、行邪術的、拜偶像的，和一切說謊話的，他們的地方就在燒着硫磺的火湖裏。這是第二次的死。」
