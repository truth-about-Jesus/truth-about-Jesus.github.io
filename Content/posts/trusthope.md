##### _Malachi 4:1-3 (ESV)_

###### \

1 “For behold, the day is coming, burning like an oven, when all the arrogant and all evildoers will be stubble. The day that is coming shall set them ablaze," says the LORD of hosts, "so that it will leave them neither root nor branch.

\

2 "But for you who fear my name, the sun of righteousness shall rise with healing in its wings. You shall go out leaping like calves from the stall.

3 And you shall tread down the wicked, for they will be ashes under the soles of your feet, on the day when I act," says the LORD of hosts.

\

##### _Malachi 4:1-3 (Chinese NET (T))_

###### \

1 (:)全能之耶和華說：「那日快到，勢如燒着的火爐，凡狂傲或行惡的必如禾稭，在那日必被燒盡，根或枝條一無存留。

\

2 「但向你們敬畏我名的人，伸冤的日頭必帶着醫治的翅膀升起。你們必跳躍如圈裏的肥犢。

3 你們必踐踏惡人；在我預備的日子，他們必如灰塵在你們腳掌之下。」這是全能之耶和華說的。

\

##### _2 Peter 3:9-14,17-18 (ESV)_

###### \

9 The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance.

\

10 But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, and then the heavens will pass away with a roar, and the heavenly bodies will be burned up and dissolved, and the earth and the works that are done on it will be exposed.

\

11 Since all these things are thus to be dissolved, what sort of people ought you to be in lives of holiness and godliness,

12 waiting for and hastening the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens will be set on fire and dissolved, and the heavenly bodies will melt as they burn!

\

13 But according to his promise we are waiting for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells.

\

14 Therefore, beloved, since you are waiting for these, be diligent to be found by him without spot or blemish, and at peace.

17 You therefore, beloved, knowing this beforehand, take care that you are not carried away with the error of lawless people and lose your own stability.

\

18 But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be the glory both now and to the day of eternity. Amen.

\

##### _2 Peter 3:9-14,17-18 (Chinese NET (T))_

###### \

9 主所應許的尚未成就，有人以為他是耽延，其實不是耽延，乃是寬容你們，因他不願有一人沉淪，乃願人人都悔改。

\

10 但主的日子要像賊來到一樣，那日天必在大響聲中廢去，眾天體都要被烈火鎔化，地和其上的物都要赤露了。

\

11 這一切既然都要如此鎔化，我們為人該當怎樣聖潔、怎樣敬虔度日、

12 切切仰望神的日子來到？因為在那日諸天被火燒就鎔化了，眾天體都要被烈火鎔化。

\

13 但我們照他的應許，等候有義居在其中的新天新地。

\

14 親愛的弟兄啊！你們既等候這些事，就當努力，使自己沒有玷污，無可指摘，安然見主。

17 親愛的弟兄啊！你們既然預先受了警惕，就當防備，恐怕被惡人的錯謬誘惑，就從自己的堅固上墜落。

\

18 你們卻要在我們主和救主耶穌基督的恩典和知識上有長進。願榮耀歸給他，從今直到永遠！阿們。

11 And many false prophets will arise and lead many astray.

12 And because lawlessness will be increased, the love of many will grow cold.

\

13 "But the one who endures to the end will be saved."

\

##### _Matthew 24:9-13 (Chinese NET (T))_

###### \

9 「那時候，世人要逼迫你們，也要殺害你們，你們也要為我的名被萬民憎恨。

\

11 且有好些假先知出現，迷惑許多人。

12 因不法的事劇增，許多人的愛心都變成冷淡了。

\

13 「但那忍耐到底的，必然得救。」

##### _Revelation 21:1-4 (ESV)_

###### \

1 Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea was no more.

\

2 And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.

\

3 And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, “Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God.

4 He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.”

\

##### _Revelation 21:1-4 (Chinese NET (T))_

###### \

1 然後，我看見一個新天新地，因為第一個天地不再存在了，海也不再有了。

\

2 我又看見聖城新耶路撒冷由 神那裏從天而降，預備好了，就如新婦裝飾整齊，等候丈夫。

\

3 我聽見有一個大聲音從寶座出來說：「看哪！ 神的居所在人間，他要與人同住。他們要作他的子民， 神要親自與他們同在。

4 神要擦去他們每一滴眼淚，不再有死亡、哀悼、哭號、疼痛，因為以前的事都不存在了。」
