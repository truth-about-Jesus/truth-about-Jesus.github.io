Jesus wants to take care of you. He loves you so much that He even lays down His life for you.



John 10:11-18 (TCENT)

11 I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.

12 But the hired hand is not the shepherd and does not own the sheep. So when he sees the wolf coming, he leaves the sheep and flees, and the wolf snatches the sheep and scatters them.

13 The hired hand flees, for he is a hired hand and does not care about the sheep.

14 I am the good shepherd. I know my sheep and my sheep know me,

15 even as the Father knows me, and I know the Father. I lay down my life for the sheep.

16 I have other sheep that are not of this fold. I must bring them also, and they will hear my voice. And there will be one flock, one shepherd.

17 This is why the Father loves me, because I lay down my life so that I may take it up again.

18 No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it up again. I received this commandment from my Father.‚Äù
