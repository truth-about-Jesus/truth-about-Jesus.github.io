Once, when Jesus was teaching his disciples amid a large crowd on a mountain, He concluded His words by explaining how one may insure a secure future:

有一次，當耶穌在山上的一大群人中教導他的門徒時，他透過解釋一個人如何確保一個安全的未來來結束他的話：

\

##### _Matthew 7:24-25 (ESV)_

###### \

24 “Everyone then who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock.

25 And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock.”

\

##### _Matthew 7:24-25 (Chinese NET (T))_

###### \

24 「凡聽見我這些話又去行的，就好像一個聰明人把房子蓋在磐石上。

25 雨淋，泛濫，風吹，房子屹立不倒，因為根基立在磐石上。

\

If we hear and obey Jesus' words, we are building our life on a solid foundation.

如果我們聆聽並遵守耶穌的話，我們就將我們的生活建立在堅實的基礎上。

\

He also warned what would happen if not:

他還警告說，如果不這樣，會發生什麼：

\

##### _Matthew 7:26-27 (ESV)_

###### \

26 “And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand.

27 And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell, and great was the fall of it.”

\

##### _Matthew 7:26-27 (Chinese NET (T))_

###### \

26 凡聽見我這些話卻不去行的，就好像一個愚蠢人把房子蓋在沙土上。

27 雨淋，泛濫，風吹，房子就倒塌了，並且是完全的毀壞。」

\

If instead we do not obey Jesus' words, we are insuring our own future collapse.

相反，如果我們不遵守耶穌的話，我們自己的未來就會崩潰。

Therefore, in addition to [sitting at His feet and listening to Jesus’ words](/posts/onething), we must also live by them.

所以，我們除了[坐在耶穌腳前聽耶穌的話之外](/posts/onething)，還必須按照祂的話去生活。
