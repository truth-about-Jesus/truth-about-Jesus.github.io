Jesus warned us that there would be "prophets" who pretend to be His followers, but who are really only looking out for their own personal gain.

耶穌警告我們，會有“先知”假裝是他的追隨者，但實際上只為自己的個人利益著想。

\

Some will even be willing to harm others in order to get what they want.

有些人甚至願意傷害別人，以獲得他們想要的東西。

\

##### _Matthew 7:15 (ESV)_

###### \

15 “Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves.”

\

##### _Matthew 7:15 (Chinese NET (T))_

###### \

15 「提防假先知，他們披着羊皮到你們這裏來，裏面卻是殘暴的狼。

He gave us a clear and simple way to recognize them: by their fruits.

他給了我們一種清晰而簡單的方法來識別它們：透過它們的果實。

\

##### _Matthew 7:16-20 (ESV)_

###### \

16 “You will recognize them by their fruits. Are grapes gathered from thornbushes, or figs from thistles?

17 So, every healthy tree bears good fruit, but the diseased tree bears bad fruit.

18 A healthy tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a diseased tree bear good fruit.

19 Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.

20 Thus you will recognize them by their fruits.”

\

##### _Matthew 7:16-20 (Chinese NET (T))_

###### \

16 你們憑着他們的果子，就可以認出他們來。荊棘上豈能摘葡萄呢？蒺藜裏豈能摘無花果呢？

17 同樣地，凡好樹都結好果子，壞樹就結壞果子。

18 好樹不能結壞果子，壞樹也不能結好果子。

19 凡不結好果子的樹，就砍下來丟在火裏。

20 所以憑着他們的果子，就可以認出他們來。

\

Just as fruit trees produce fruit, so every person produces something. If someone claims to be a prophet who is following Jesus, they should be producing good fruit.

就像果樹結出果實一樣，每個人都能產生一些東西。 如果有人聲稱自己是跟隨耶穌的先知，他們應該會結出好果。

what is *bad* fruit?

什麼是壞水果？

\

##### _Galatians 5:19-21 (ESV)_

###### \

19 Now the works of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality,

20 idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, divisions,

21 envy, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.

\

##### _Galatians 5:19-21 (Chinese NET (T))_

###### \

19 肉體的事，都是顯而易見的，就如姦淫、污穢、邪蕩、

20 拜偶像、邪術、敵意、不和、妬忌、發怒、爭執、齟齬、分黨、

21 嫉妒、謀殺、醉酒、邪蕩等類。我從前警告過你們，現在又警告你們：行這樣事的人，必不能承受 神的國。

\

what is *good* fruit?

什麼是好水果？

\

##### _Galatians 5:22-24 (ESV)_

###### \

22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,

23 gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law.

24 And those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.

\

##### _Galatians 5:22-24 (Chinese NET (T))_

###### \

22 聖靈所結的果子，就是愛、喜樂、和平、忍耐、恩慈、良善、信實、

23 溫柔、節制。這樣的事，沒有律法反對。

24 凡屬基督的人，是已經把肉體，連肉體的情慾和渴求，同釘在十字架上了。

\
\

if a person claims to speak for God yet produces bad fruit, they are not His follower but a wolf in sheep's clothing, no matter what they say or do.

如果一個人聲稱為上帝說話，但卻結出了不好的果實，那麼他們不是他的追隨者，而是披著羊皮的狼，不管他們說什麼或做什麼。

\

so, not everyone can be trusted.

所以不是每個人都能被信任。

\

##### _Matthew 7:21-23 (ESV)_

###### \

21 “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.

22 On that day many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?’

23 And then will I declare to them, ‘I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.’”

\

##### _Matthew 7:21-23 (Chinese NET (T))_

###### \

21 「不是所有稱呼我『主啊！主啊』的人都能進天國，只有遵行我天父旨意的人才能進去。

22 當那日，必有許多人對我說：『主啊！主啊！我們不是奉你的名說預言，奉你的名趕鬼，奉你的名行許多異能嗎？』

23 我就對他們宣稱：『我從來不認識你們。你們這些不守法的人，離開我去吧！』
