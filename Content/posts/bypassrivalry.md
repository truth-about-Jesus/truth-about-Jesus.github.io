Have you ever found yourself in a situation in which it seemed impossible for you to get something you needed or wanted, because of another person -- or even many others?

你是否曾經發現自己處於這樣一種境地，即因為另一個人——甚至許多其他人，你似乎無法得到你需要或想要的東西？

\

Sometimes there appears to be only a little -- or even only one -- of something that others also desire...

有時，似乎只有一點點——甚至只有一個——其他人也渴望的東西......

\

resulting in competition, or what the Bible calls rivalry.

導致競爭，或聖經所說的紛爭。

Some of us like to watch sports, in which teams -- or individuals -- compete against each other for a trophy or cup or award -- or merely the honour of being crowned champion.

我們中的一些人喜歡看體育比賽，其中團隊——或個人——相互競爭獎盃、杯子或獎項——或者僅僅是為了加冕冠軍的榮譽。

\

Only one team or competitor can win, but there are more than one, so this is competition, or rivalry -- as a form of entertainment.

只有一個團隊或競爭對手可以獲勝，但不止一個，所以這就是競爭或紛爭——作為一種娛樂形式。

\

But what if the thing you want or need could drastically improve your quality of life?

但是，如果你想要或需要的東西可以大大提高你的生活質量呢？

\

And what if there are so many others competing for the same thing, that your outlook is practically hopeless?

如果有這麼多其他人在爭奪同樣的東西，以至於你的前景幾乎是無望的呢？

Jesus met a man in exactly this situation. 

耶穌正是在這種情況下遇到了一個人。

\

This man, whom Jesus met in Jerusalem, near a pool called Bethesda, had been unwell for 38 years.

耶穌在耶路撒冷一個叫貝塞斯達的水池附近遇到的這個人，已經不舒服38年了。

\

Now, Bethesda was a very special pool.

現在，貝塞斯達是一個非常特別的水池。

\

You see, every so often, an angel would come down from Heaven and stir up the water.

你看，每隔一段時間，天使就會從天堂下來攪動水。

\

After that, the very first person to get into the pool would be healed from whatever sickness or disability they had!

在那之後，第一個進入水池的人將從他們的疾病或殘疾中痊癒！

\

\
\

But -- there was a problem.

但是——有一個問題。

\

This pool was surrounded by a huge crowd of people who were unwell -- including blind, lame and paralyzed folks. They were all waiting for the water to be stirred, in hopes they could be the first one in, to be healed.

這個水池周圍是一大群身體不適的人——包括盲人、瘸子和癱瘓的人。 他們都在等待水被攪動，希望他們能成為第一個進來的人，被治癒。

\

This man needed help to get in the water, but -- he didn't have anyone to help him.

這個人需要幫助才能下水，但是——他沒有人幫助他。

\

So he stayed there, by the pool, in this unwinnable competition, never getting what he wanted.

因此，在這場無法獲勝的競爭中，他呆在游泳池邊，從未得到他想要的東西。

\

<center>💠</center>

\
\

One day, Jesus came and saw him, in the midst of all those other people with various sicknesses or disabilities, and came up to him and asked, "Do you want to get well?"

有一天，耶穌在所有其他患有各種疾病或殘疾的人中間看到他，走到他面前問道：「你想被治癒嗎？」

\

So, the man who had been unwell for 38 years explained to Jesus, "Sir, i have no one to help me. When the water is stirred, just as i'm trying to get into the pool, someone else always gets in ahead of me."

因此，這位身體不適38年的人向耶穌解釋說：「先生，我沒有人幫助我。 當水被攪動時，就在我試圖進入池子時，別人總是比我先進來。」

\

I guess he must have meant, "Yes, of course i want to get well, but -- no matter how hard i try... i never win" --

我猜他一定是想說：「是的，我當然想被治愈，但是——無論我如何努力......我都不會贏」——

\

because only one person could win, in that situation of rivalry: the quickest.

因為在競爭的情況下，只有一個人可以獲勝：最快的。

\

And he was anything but.

他很慢。

\

Then Jesus cut to the chase.

然後耶穌直奔主題。

\

"Get up, take up your mat, and walk."

「起來，拿起你的墊子，然後走路。」

\

<center>💠</center>

\
\

And just like that, the man was healed!

立刻，那人就痊癒了！

\

He hadn't needed to win, after all.

畢竟，他不需要贏。

\

All he really needed... 

他真正需要的只是......

\

was Jesus.

是耶穌。
