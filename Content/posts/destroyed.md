Some of us are destroyed on the inside. 

我們中的一些人內心被摧毀了。

\

Where others have a healthy sense of self and well-being, we feel only a desperate, insatiable hunger -- a bottomless pit of need.

當其他人有健康的自我意識和幸福感時，我們只感到一種絕望的、貪得無厭的飢餓——一個無底洞的需求。

\

We have tried to fill it in various ways -- only, always, in the end, to be disappointed (and sometimes humiliated) because 

我們嘗試不同的方式來填補它 - 但總是以失望（有時甚至是感到羞辱）告終，因為

\

the hunger is still voraciously present.  

飢餓仍然貪婪地存在。

\

We feel like we are less than a person -- a fraction or even a negative number -- while others are a healthy, positive whole number.

我們覺得自己不如一個人——一個分數甚至一個負數——而其他人是一個健康的正整數。

\

We may even have come to the point where we've given up trying to fill the endless, aching void...

我們甚至可能已經到了放棄試圖填補無盡、痛苦的空白的地步......

\

and yet it remains --

但它仍然存在——

\

deep, cavernous, gaping... 

深邃的、空洞的、張開的......

\

unfathomable.

深不可測的。

\

*i speak from personal experience:*

我是根據個人經驗說的：

\

*i am, myself, such a person.* 

我，我自己，就是這樣的人。

\

*i am not sure how i became this way...*

我不確定我是怎麼變成這樣的......

\

*however, i suspect it had to do with the fact that in childhood i felt unloved, disliked and even rejected by a primary caregiver who had significant influence over me.* 

然而，我懷疑這與這樣一個事實有關，即在童年時，我感到不被愛、不喜歡，甚至被一個對我有重大影響的主要照顧者拒絕。

\

*although there are times when i manage not to be aware of the obliteration inside...*

雖然有些時候我設法沒有意識到內心的消滅......

\

*it eventually, inevitably, worms its way back into consciousness.* 

它最終不可避免地會回到意識中。

\
\

Is there any hope for people like me -- like us?

像我這樣的人——像我們這樣的人還有希望嗎？

\

What about Jesus? Can He do what we cannot: fill the bottomless pit?

耶穌呢？ 他能做我們做不到的事嗎：填補無底洞？

\

*Would* He?

他會嗎？

\

Or would He just reject and abandon us, if we were honest with Him...

或者，如果我們對他誠實，他會拒絕並拋棄我們......

\

as others have done?

就像其他人所做的那樣？

Jesus told the Samaritan woman He met at a well:

耶穌告訴他在井裡遇到的撒瑪利亞婦女：

\

##### _John 4:23-24 (ESV)_

23 "But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father is seeking such people to worship him.

24 God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.”

\

##### _John 4:23-24 (Chinese NET (T))_

23 ｢不過時候將到，如今就是了，那真正拜父的，要用靈和真理拜他，因為父尋找這樣的人拜他。

\

If we want to follow Jesus, we have to be honest with Him about the situation inside. There isn't any other way.

如果我們想要跟隨耶穌，我們就必須向祂誠實地說出我們內心的狀況。沒有其他辦法。

\

And the truth is: 

事實是：

\

Jesus already knows.

耶穌已經知道我們內心的想法。

\

##### _John 2:23-25 (NIV)_

23 Now while he was in Jerusalem at the Passover Festival, many people saw the signs he was performing and believed in his name.

24 But Jesus would not entrust himself to them, for he knew all people.

25 He did not need any testimony about mankind, for he knew what was in each person.

\

##### _John 2:23-25 (Chinese NET (T))_

23 當耶穌在耶路撒冷過逾越節的時候，許多人因看見他所行的神蹟，就信了他的名。

24 耶穌卻不將自己交託他們，因為他認識萬人；

25 也用不着誰為人作見證，因他看透人心。

So... what will Jesus do when we, who are destroyed on the inside, come to Him?

所以......當我們內心被摧毀的人來到他面前時，耶穌會做什麼？
