wildfires, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, volcanoes, global warming, sea level rise... every day there are new, frightening headlines about how this earth is turning into a place uninhabitable for humans... and that it may be too late to stop it now...

野火、洪水、龍捲風、颶風、地震、火山、全球變暖、海平面上升......每天都有新的、可怕的頭條新聞，關於地球如何變成一個人類無法居住的地方......現在阻止它可能為時已晚......

\

scientists sounded the alarm years ago; today their warnings are our reality as catastrophe after destructive catastrophe strikes all over the world...

科學家們幾年前就敲響了警鐘；今天，他們的警告是我們的現實，就像世界各地發生破壞性災難之後的災難一樣......

\

##### _2 Peter 2:1-2 (GNB)_
###### \

1 False prophets appeared in the past among the people, and in the same way false teachers will appear among you. They will bring in destructive, untrue doctrines, and will deny the Master who redeemed them, and so they will bring upon themselves sudden destruction.

2 Even so, many will follow their immoral ways; and because of what they do, others will speak evil of the Way of truth.

\

##### _2 Peter 2:1-2 (Chinese NET (T))_

###### \

1 但是從前在百姓中有假先知起來，將來在你們中間也必有假師傅，將秘密引進導致滅亡的異端，甚至連買他們的主也不承認，帶來速速的滅亡。

2 將有許多人隨從他們邪淫的行為，便叫真道因他們的緣故被毀謗。

\

are many speaking evil of the way of truth -- [God's rescue of the earth's people through His Son Jesus](/posts/family) -- today?

現在說真理道壞話的人多嗎？ （[上帝通過他的兒子耶穌拯救地球上的人民](/posts/family)）

\

yes.

是的。

\

why?

為什麼？

\

because of false prophets and false teachers -- false church leaders -- teaching and committing sexual immorality -- even going so far as to sexually abuse young children!!!

因為假先知和假教師——假教會領袖——教導和實施性不道德——甚至對幼兒進行性虐待！！！

##### _2 Peter 2:12-14,18-21 (GNB)_

###### \

12 But these people act by instinct, like wild animals born to be captured and killed; they attack with insults anything they do not understand. They will be destroyed like wild animals,

13 and they will be paid with suffering for the suffering they have caused. Pleasure for them is to do anything in broad daylight that will satisfy their bodily appetites; they are a shame and a disgrace as they join you in your meals, all the while enjoying their deceitful ways!

14 They want to look for nothing but the chance to commit adultery; their appetite for sin is never satisfied. They lead weak people into a trap. Their hearts are trained to be greedy. They are under God's curse!

18 They make proud and stupid statements, and use immoral bodily lusts to trap those who are just beginning to escape from among people who live in error.

19 They promise them freedom while they themselves are slaves of destructive habits -- for we are slaves of anything that has conquered us.

20 If people have escaped from the corrupting forces of the world through their knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and then are again caught and conquered by them, such people are in worse condition at the end than they were at the beginning.

21 It would have been much better for them never to have known the way of righteousness than to know it and then turn away from the sacred command that was given them.

\

##### _2 Peter 2:12-14,18-21 (Chinese NET (T))_

###### \

12 但這些人好像沒有理性的畜類、憑本能的動物，生來就是為被捉拿宰殺的；他們不知道自己所毀謗的，後果是敗壞人的時候，自己必遭遇敗壞；

13 行的有害，就得了害為工價。這些人以在白晝歡宴為樂，他們是污點，又是瑕疵，與你們一同坐席的時候，就放縱自己欺詐的喜好；

14 他們滿眼是淫色，從不停止犯罪；又引誘那心不堅固的人。他們心中習慣了貪婪，正是被咒詛的兒女！

18 他們大言不慚，說空洞的話，用肉身的情慾和邪淫的事引誘那些剛脫離妄行的人；

19 他們應許人得以自由，自己卻作了敗壞的奴僕，因為人被誰制伏就是誰的奴僕。

20 倘若他們因對主和救主耶穌基督有豐富的知識，脫離了世上的污穢，後來又被污穢纏住制伏，他們末後的景況就比先前更不好了。

21 他們曉得義路，卻又從傳給他們的聖潔命令轉離，倒不如不曉得為妙。

\

why is the whole earth being destroyed when not all of us are false church leaders?

當我們不是所有人都是虛假的教會領袖時，為什麼整個地球都被摧毀了？

\

because many are still turning a blind eye and allowing the evil to continue.

因為許多人仍然視而不見，讓邪惡繼續下去。

\

in His letter to the church in Thyatira, Jesus first commends them for their love, faithfulness, service and patience.

在給推雅推喇教堂的信中，耶穌首先讚揚了他們的愛、忠誠、服務和耐心。

\

sounds like a great church, right?

聽起來像是一個偉大的教會，對嗎？

\

but then He says:

但後來他說：

\

##### _Revelation 2:20 (GNB)_

###### \

20 But this is what I have against you: you tolerate that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a messenger of God. By her teaching she misleads my servants into practicing sexual immorality and eating food that has been offered to idols.

\

##### _Revelation 2:20 (Chinese NET (T))_

###### \

20 然而有一件事我要責備你：就是你容讓那自稱是先知的婦人耶洗別教導我的僕人，引誘他們行姦淫和吃祭偶像之物。

\

when we do nothing about known sexually immoral and abusive church leaders -- especially if we have the authority to remove them -- we become as guilty as they are. 

當我們對那些眾所周知的性不道德和性虐待的教會領袖袖手旁觀時——特別是如果我們有權罷免他們——我們就和他們一樣有罪。

\

Jesus has a special place in His Heart for children. 

耶穌在他的心中對孩子們有著特殊的位置。

\

##### _Matthew 18:1-5 (GNB)_

###### \

1 At that time the disciples came to Jesus, asking, "Who is the greatest in the Kingdom of heaven?"

2 So Jesus called a child to come and stand in front of them,

3 and said, "I assure you that unless you change and become like children, you will never enter the Kingdom of heaven.

4 The greatest in the Kingdom of heaven is the one who humbles himself and becomes like this child.

5 And whoever welcomes in my name one such child as this, welcomes me."

\

##### _Matthew 18:1-5 (Chinese NET (T))_

###### \

1 那時，門徒進前來，問耶穌說：「天國裏誰是最大的？」

2 耶穌叫一個小孩子來，使他站在他們當中，

3 說：「我實在告訴你們，你們若不回轉，變成像小孩子，絕對不得進天國！

4 所以凡謙卑像這小孩子的，他在天國裏就是最大的。

5 凡為我的名，接待一個像這小孩子的，就是接待我。」

\

then He adds a stern warning:

然後他添加了一個嚴厲的警告：

\

##### _Matthew 18:6 (GNB)_

###### \
 
6 "If anyone should cause one of these little ones to lose his faith in me, it would be better for that person to have a large millstone tied around his neck and be drowned in the deep sea."

\

##### _Matthew 18:6 (Chinese NET (T))_

###### \

6 「但是凡使這信我的一個小子犯罪的，倒不如把大磨石拴在這人的頸項上，沉在深海裏。」

\
\

this is what's happening to us today. millions of children are losing their faith after being sexually abused by a trusted church leader. and the earth is being destroyed.

這就是今天發生在我們身上的事情。數百萬兒童在被一位值得信賴的教會領袖性虐待後正在失去信仰。地球正在被摧毀。

\

let's quit tolerating sexual immorality and sexual abuse in our church leaders!!!

讓我們停止容忍教會領袖的性不道德和性虐待！！！

\

we must remove them from their positions of leadership and not hide what they have done.

我們必須將他們從主管崗位上除名，而不是掩蓋他們的所作所為。
