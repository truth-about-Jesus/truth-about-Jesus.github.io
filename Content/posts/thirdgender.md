there is already a recognized -- though rare -- third gender: intersex (formerly known as hermaphrodite).

已經有一個公認的——雖然罕見的——第三性別：雙性人（以前被稱為雌雄同體）。

God is Himself a third gender, since Genesis 1:27 states that He is both male and female.

上帝本身就是第三性別，因為《創世紀》1:27指出，他既是男性又是女性。

\

##### _Genesis 1:27 (MKJV)_

###### \

27 And God created man in His image; in the image of God He created him. He created them male and female.

\

##### _Genesis 1:27 (Chinese NET (T))_

###### \

27 神就照着自己的形像造人，照着自己的形像他造了人，他造了男和女。

since the image of God is both male and female, it stands to reason that, as far as gender goes, an androgynous person more fully represents God's image than someone who is only one gender or the other. 

由於上帝的形象既是男性的，也是女性，就性別而言，一個雌雄同體的人比一個只有一種性別的人更充分地代表上帝的形象，這是合乎情理的。

a traditional married couple can be considered a third gender, since they become one flesh encompassing both genders.

###### \

24 Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.

\

##### _Genesis 2:24 (Translated from ESV)_

God Himself states through the prophet Jeremiah that He has created a third gender.

###### \

22 不忠心的女兒啊，你還要來回多久？ 因為耶和華在這地上創造了一件新事；一個女人 _[希伯來語的意思是女性的身體]_ 要包圍一個男人 _[希伯來語的意思是戰士或有權有權力的人]_。

God says there can be a dichotomy between what is inside and what is outside, but that He is most interested in what is inside.

7 But the LORD said to Samuel, “Do not look on his appearance or on the height of his stature, because I have rejected him. For the LORD sees not as man sees: man looks on the outward appearance, but the LORD looks on the heart.”

\

##### _1 Samuel 16:7 (Chinese NET (T))_

###### \

7 耶和華卻對撒母耳說：「不要看他的外貌和他身材高大，我不揀選他。因為耶和華不像人看人：人是看外貌，耶和華是看內心。」

Jesus mentioned, and approved of, a third gender: eunuchs.

耶穌提到並批准了第三種性別：太監。

\

##### _Matthew 19:10-12 (ESV)_

###### \

10 The disciples said to him, “If such is the case of a man with his wife, it is better not to marry.”

11 But he said to them, “Not everyone can receive this saying, but only those to whom it is given.

12 For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let the one who is able to receive this receive it.”

\

##### _Matthew 19:10-12 (Translated from ESV)_

###### \

10 門徒對他說：“如果男人和妻子是這樣的情況，最好不要結婚。”

11 但他對他們說：“不是每個人都能接受這句話，只有那些被賦予這句話的人才能接受。

12 因為有些太監從出生就如此，有些太監被人封為太監，有些太監為了天國而自封為太監。 讓能夠收到這個的人收到它。”

therefore, there really are more than two genders and, according to the Bible, transgender, non-binary and intersex people are, at worst, a non-issue, and at best, created, designed and approved by God.

因此，確實存在不止兩種性別。 根據聖經，變性人、非二元性別者和雙性人在最壞的情況下也不是問題。 在最好的情況下，它們是由上帝創造、設計和認可的。
