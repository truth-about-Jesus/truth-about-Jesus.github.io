While teaching His followers on a mountain, Jesus spoke of two possible ways one can go in life.

當耶穌在山上教導門徒時，他談到了兩條可能的人生道路。

\

##### _Matthew 7:13-14 (ESV)_

###### \

13 “Enter by the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many.

14 For the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find it are few."

\

##### _Matthew 7:13-14 (Chinese NET (T))_

###### \

13 「你們要進窄門，因為引到滅亡的門是闊的，路是大的，進去的人也多。

14 引到生命的門是窄的，路是小的，找着的人也少。

\

But -- where is this narrow gate? And where is this hard way that leads to life?

但是——這個狹窄的門在哪裡？ 這種通往生活的艱難方式在哪裡？

\

How can we find it?

我們怎麼能找到它？

Later, while speaking with the Jews in Jerusalem, Jesus called Himself "the Door":

後來，耶穌在耶路撒冷對猶太人講話時稱自己為「門」：

\

##### _John 10:7-10 (ESV)_

###### \

7 So Jesus again said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.

8 All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them.

9 I am the door. If anyone enters by me, he will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture.

10 The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life and have it abundantly."

\

##### _John 10:7-10 (Chinese NET (T))_

###### \

7 所以耶穌又對他們說：「我告訴你們嚴肅的真理，我就是羊的門。

8 凡比我先來的都是賊、是強盜，羊卻不聽他們。

9 我就是門，凡從我進來的，必然得救，並且出入，又得草場。

10 盜賊來，無非要偷竊、宰殺，及毀壞；我來了，是要叫他們得生命，並且得的更豐盛。

\
\

Jesus called Himself "the Way" when speaking with His Apostles the night before He was crucified. 

耶穌在被釘十字架的前一天晚上與使徒交談時，稱自己為「道路」。

\

##### _John 14:6 (ESV)_

###### \

6 Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me."

\

##### _John 14:6 (Chinese NET (T))_

###### \

6 耶穌說：「我就是道路、真理、生命；若不藉着我，沒有人能到父那裏去。

\

\
\

Clearly, according to Jesus' teaching, not all roads lead to God. 

顯然，根據耶穌的教導，並非所有道路都通向上帝。

\

Only Jesus is the narrow door and the hard way that leads to life.

只有耶穌是通往生命的狹窄大門和艱難的道路。
