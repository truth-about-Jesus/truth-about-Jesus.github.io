#  你想屬於上帝的家庭嗎?

\

On earth we are born into a biological family -- we have a mom and dad and sometimes brothers and sisters, grandparents, uncles, aunts and cousins.

在地球上，我們出生在一個親生家庭——我們有一個爸爸媽媽，有時還有兄弟姐妹、祖父母、叔叔、姑姑和表兄弟姐妹。

Jesus was born into a biological family, too. His mother Mary was a virgin when He was conceived through the Holy Spirit. His foster father was Joseph. He had brothers and sisters.

耶穌也出生在一個親生家庭。 當他透過聖靈受孕時，他的母親瑪麗是處女。 他的養父是約瑟夫。 他有兄弟姐妹。

\

##### _Luke 1:30-35,37 (NET)_

###### \

30 So the angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God!

31 Listen: You will become pregnant and give birth to a son, and you will name him Jesus.

32 He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give him the throne of his father David.

33 He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and his kingdom will never end.”

34 Mary said to the angel, “How will this be, since I have not been intimate with a man?”

35 The angel replied, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. Therefore the child to be born will be holy; he will be called the Son of God.

37 For nothing will be impossible with God.”

\

##### _Luke 1:30-35,37 (Chinese NET (T\)\)_

30 天使對她說：「馬利亞！不要怕；你在 神面前已經蒙恩了。

31 聽着：你要懷孕生子，你要給他起名叫耶穌。

32 他要為大，稱為至高者的兒子；主 神要把他祖大衛的位給他；

33 他要作雅各家的王，直到永遠，他的國也沒有窮盡。」

34 馬利亞對天使說：「這怎麼可能呢，我還沒有出嫁？」

35 天使回答說：「聖靈要臨到你身上，至高者的能力要蔭庇你。因此所要生的兒子必為聖，稱為 神的兒子。

37 因為在 神無所不能。」

\

##### _Matthew 1:18-25 (NET)_

###### \

18 Now the birth of Jesus Christ happened this way. While his mother Mary was engaged to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be pregnant through the Holy Spirit.

19 Because Joseph, her husband to be, was a righteous man, and because he did not want to disgrace her, he intended to divorce her privately.

20 When he had contemplated this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, because the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.

21 She will give birth to a son and you will name him Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.”

22 This all happened so that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet would be fulfilled:

23 “Look! The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will name him Emmanuel,” which means “God with us.”

24 When Joseph awoke from sleep he did what the angel of the Lord told him. He took his wife,

25 but did not have marital relations with her until she gave birth to a son, whom he named Jesus.

\

##### _Matthew 1:18-25 (Chinese NET (T))_

###### \

18 耶穌基督降生的事記在下面：他母親馬利亞已經和約瑟訂了婚，還沒有成婚，馬利亞就從聖靈懷了孕。

19 她的未婚夫約瑟是個義人，不願公開的令她難堪，想暗中和她解除婚約。

20 正思念這事的時候，有主的一位天使在夢中向他顯現，說：「大衛的子孫約瑟，不要怕，只管娶馬利亞為妻，因她所懷的孕是從聖靈來的。

21 她將要生一個兒子，你要給他起名叫耶穌，因他要將自己的百姓從他們的罪惡裏救出來。」

22 這一切的事成就，是要應驗主藉先知所說的話：

23 「必有童貞女懷孕生子，人要稱他的名為以馬內利。」就是「 神與我們同在」的意思。

24 約瑟醒了，起來，就遵着主天使的吩咐，把妻子娶過來；

25 只是沒有和她同房，等她生了兒子，就給他起名叫耶穌。

\

##### _Matthew 13:54-56 (NET)_

###### \

54 Then he came to his hometown and began to teach the people in their synagogue. They were astonished and said, “Where did this man get such wisdom and miraculous powers?

55 Isn’t this the carpenter’s son? Isn’t his mother named Mary? And aren’t his brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?

56 And aren’t all his sisters here with us? So where did he get all this?”

\

##### _Matthew 13:54-56 (Chinese NET (T))_

###### \

54 回到家鄉，在會堂裏教導人。他們都希奇，說：「這人從那裏有這種智慧和異能呢？

55 這不是木匠的兒子嗎？他母親不是叫馬利亞嗎？他弟弟們不是叫雅各、約瑟、西門和猶大嗎？

56 他妹妹們不是都和我們在這裏嗎？他從那裏得到這一切呢？」

Once when Jesus was young growing up in the small town of Nazareth, He gave His parents a fright on a trip to the city of Jerusalem.

有一次，當耶穌在拿撒勒小鎮長大時，他在耶路撒冷城旅行時嚇唬他的父母。

\

##### _Luke 2:41-52 (NET)_

###### \

41 Now Jesus’ parents went to Jerusalem every year for the Feast of the Passover.

42 When he was twelve years old, they went up according to custom.

43 But when the feast was over, as they were returning home, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. His parents did not know it,

44 but (because they assumed that he was in their group of travelers) they went a day’s journey. Then they began to look for him among their relatives and acquaintances.

45 When they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem to look for him.

46 After three days they found him in the temple courts, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions.

47 And all who heard Jesus were astonished at his understanding and his answers.

48 When his parents saw him, they were overwhelmed. His mother said to him, “Child, why have you treated us like this? Look, your father and I have been looking for you anxiously.”

49 But he replied, “Why were you looking for me? Didn’t you know that I must be in my Father’s house?”

50 Yet his parents did not understand the remark he made to them.

51 Then he went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was obedient to them. But his mother kept all these things in her heart.

52 And Jesus increased in wisdom and in stature, and in favor with God and with people.

##### _Luke 2:41-52 (Chinese NET (T))_

41 每年到逾越節，耶穌的父母就上耶路撒冷去。

42 當他十二歲的時候，他們按着慣例上去過節。

43 守滿了節期，回去的時候，孩童耶穌留在耶路撒冷，他的父母並不知道，

44 以為他在同行的人中間，走了一天的路程後，就在親族和熟識的人中找他。

45 既找不着，就回耶路撒冷去找他。

46 過了三天，就在殿院裏找到他，坐在教師中間，一面聽，一面問。

47 凡聽見他的，都驚訝他的聰明和他的應對。

48 當他父母看見了他，就很激動。母親對他說：「我兒，為甚麼這樣對待我們呢？你看，你父親和我十分擔心的來找你。」

49 耶穌說：「你們為甚麼找我呢？豈不知我應當在我父的家裏嗎？」

50 他所說的這話，他們卻不明白。

51 然後他就同他們下去，回到拿撒勒，並且順從他們。他母親卻把這一切的事都存在心裏。

52 耶穌的智慧和身量，並 神和人喜愛他的心，都一齊增長。

1 Now on the third day there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee. Jesus’ mother was there,

2 and Jesus and his disciples were also invited to the wedding.

3 When the wine ran out, Jesus’ mother said to him, “They have no wine left.”

4 Jesus replied, “Woman, why are you saying this to me? My time has not yet come.”

5 His mother told the servants, “Whatever he tells you, do it.”

6 Now there were six stone water jars there for Jewish ceremonial washing, each holding twenty or thirty gallons.

7 Jesus told the servants, “Fill the water jars with water.” So they filled them up to the very top.

8 Then he told them, “Now draw some out and take it to the head steward,” and they did.

9 When the head steward tasted the water that had been turned to wine, not knowing where it came from (though the servants who had drawn the water knew), he called the bridegroom

10 and said to him, “Everyone serves the good wine first, and then the cheaper wine when the guests are drunk. You have kept the good wine until now!”

11 Jesus did this as the first of his miraculous signs, in Cana of Galilee. In this way he revealed his glory, and his disciples believed in him.

12 After this he went down to Capernaum with his mother and brothers and his disciples, and they stayed there a few days.

1 到了第三日，在加利利的迦拿有一個婚宴。耶穌的母親在那裏，

2 耶穌和門徒也被請去赴宴。

3 酒用盡了，耶穌的母親對他說：「他們沒有酒了。」

4 耶穌說：「婦人！你為甚麼對我說這話呢？我的時候還沒有到。」

5 他母親對用人說：「他叫你們做甚麼，你們就做甚麼。」

6 照猶太人潔淨的規矩，有六口石缸擺在那裏，每口可以盛兩三桶水。

7 耶穌對用人說：「把缸倒滿了水。」他們就倒滿了，直到缸口。

8 耶穌又說：「現在可以舀出來，送給筵席總管。」他們就送了去。

9 筵席總管嘗了那用水變的酒，並不知道是那裏來的（雖然舀水的用人知道），便叫新郎來，

10 對他說：「人家總是先擺上好酒，等客人喝夠了，才擺上較次的；你卻把好酒留到現在！」

11 這是耶穌所行的第一件神蹟，是在加利利的迦拿行的，顯出了他的榮耀，他的門徒就信他了。

12 這事以後，耶穌與他的母親、弟兄和門徒一起下迦百農去，在那裏住了幾日。

5 They replied, “Jesus the Nazarene.” He told them, “I am he.” (Now Judas, the one who betrayed him, was standing there with them.)

6 So when Jesus said to them, “I am he,” they retreated and fell to the ground.

7 Then Jesus asked them again, “Who are you looking for?” And they said, “Jesus the Nazarene.”

8 Jesus replied, “I told you that I am he. If you are looking for me, let these men go.”

9 He said this to fulfill the word he had spoken, “I have not lost a single one of those whom you gave me.”

10 Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, pulled it out and struck the high priest’s slave, cutting off his right ear. (Now the slave’s name was Malchus.)

11 But Jesus said to Peter, “Put your sword back into its sheath! Am I not to drink the cup that the Father has given me?”

12 Then the squad of soldiers with their commanding officer and the officers of the Jewish leaders arrested Jesus and tied him up.

3 於是猶大領了一隊兵和祭司長並法利賽人的衛士，拿着燈籠、火把和兵器，來到園裏。

4 耶穌既知道將要臨到自己的一切事，就出來，對他們說：「你們找誰？」

5 他們回答說：「找拿撒勒人耶穌。」耶穌說：「我就是。」（出賣他的猶大也同他們站在那裏。）

6 耶穌一說「我就是」，他們就退後倒在地上。

7 他又問他們說：「你們找誰？」他們說：「找拿撒勒人耶穌。」

8 耶穌說：「我已經告訴你們，我就是。你們若找我，就讓這些人去吧。」

9 這是要應驗耶穌從前說的話：「你所賜給我的人，我沒有失落一個。」

10 當時西門彼得帶着一把刀，就拔出來，將大祭司的奴僕砍了一刀，削掉他的右耳。（那奴僕名叫馬勒古。）

11 耶穌就對彼得說：「收刀入鞘吧！我父給我的杯，我豈可不喝呢？」

12 那隊兵和千夫長並猶太人領袖的衛士就拿住耶穌，把他捆綁了，

53 Then they led Jesus to the high priest, and all the chief priests and elders and experts in the law came together.

54 And Peter had followed him from a distance, up to the high priest’s courtyard. He was sitting with the guards and warming himself by the fire.

55 The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death, but they did not find anything.

56 Many gave false testimony against him, but their testimony did not agree.

57 Some stood up and gave this false testimony against him:

58 “We heard him say, ‘I will destroy this temple made with hands and in three days build another not made with hands.’”

59 Yet even on this point their testimony did not agree.

60 Then the high priest stood up before them and asked Jesus, “Have you no answer? What is this that they are testifying against you?”

61 But he was silent and did not answer. Again the high priest questioned him, “Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?”

62 “I am,” said Jesus, “and you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power and coming with the clouds of heaven.”

63 Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, “Why do we still need witnesses?

64 You have heard the blasphemy! What is your verdict?” They all condemned him as deserving death.

65 Then some began to spit on him, and to blindfold him, and to strike him with their fists, saying, “Prophesy!” The guards also took him and beat him.

66 Now while Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the high priest’s slave girls came by.

67 When she saw Peter warming himself, she looked directly at him and said, “You also were with that Nazarene, Jesus.”

68 But he denied it: “I don’t even understand what you’re talking about!” Then he went out to the gateway, and a rooster crowed.

69 When the slave girl saw him, she began again to say to the bystanders, “This man is one of them.”

70 But he denied it again. A short time later the bystanders again said to Peter, “You must be one of them, because you are also a Galilean.”

71 Then he began to curse, and he swore with an oath, “I do not know this man you are talking about!”

72 Immediately a rooster crowed a second time. Then Peter remembered what Jesus had said to him: “Before a rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.” And he broke down and wept.

53 他們就把耶穌帶到大祭司那裏，眾祭司長和長老並律法師都來了。

54 彼得遠遠的跟着耶穌，直到進入大祭司的院裏，和差役一同坐在火旁取暖。

55 祭司長和全公會找尋控告耶穌的證據，定他死罪，卻尋不着。

56 有好些人作假見證，只是他們的見證各不相合。

57 又有幾個人站起來，作這假見證告他，

58 說：「我們聽見他說：『我要拆毀這人手所造的殿，三日內就另造一座不是人手所造的。』」

59 就是這樣的見證，他們也是各不相合。

60 於是大祭司站起來，問耶穌說：「你甚麼都不回答嗎？這些人作見證告你的是甚麼呢？」

61 耶穌卻不言語，一句也不回答。大祭司又問他說：「你是基督，那當稱頌者的兒子嗎？」

62 耶穌說：「我是。你們必看見人子坐在那權能者的右邊，又駕着天上的雲降臨。」

63 大祭司就撕開衣服，說：「我們何必再用證人呢？

64 你們已經聽見他這僭妄的話了；你們的判決如何？」他們都定他死罪。

65 就有人向他吐唾沫，又蒙着他的眼睛，用拳頭打他，對他說：「說預言吧！」差役也過他來打他。

66 當時彼得在下邊的院子裏，大祭司的一個僕婢走來，

67 見彼得在烤火，就看着他說：「你也是跟那個拿撒勒人耶穌同夥的。」

68 彼得卻不承認，說：「我不明白你說的是甚麼！」於是出來，到了前門，雞就叫了。

69 那僕婢看見了，又對旁邊站着的人說：「這人是他們一黨的。」

70 彼得又不承認。過了一會兒，旁邊站着的人就對彼得說：「你真是他們一黨的，因為你是加利利人。」

71 彼得就發咒起誓的說：「我不認識你們說的這個人！」

72 立時雞叫了第二遍。彼得想起耶穌對他所說的話：「雞叫兩遍以前，你要三次不認我。」思想起來，就哭了。

1 Now very early on the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene came to the tomb and saw that the stone had been moved away from the entrance.

2 So she went running to Simon Peter and the other disciple whom Jesus loved and told them, “They have taken the Lord from the tomb, and we don’t know where they have put him!”

3 Then Peter and the other disciple set out to go to the tomb.

4 The two were running together, but the other disciple ran faster than Peter and reached the tomb first.

5 He bent down and saw the strips of linen cloth lying there, but he did not go in.

6 Then Simon Peter, who had been following him, arrived and went right into the tomb. He saw the strips of linen cloth lying there,

7 and the face cloth, which had been around Jesus’ head, not lying with the strips of linen cloth but rolled up in a place by itself.

8 Then the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, came in, and he saw and believed.

9 (For they did not yet understand the scripture that Jesus must rise from the dead.)

10 So the disciples went back to their homes.

11 But Mary stood outside the tomb weeping. As she wept, she bent down and looked into the tomb.

12 And she saw two angels in white sitting where Jesus’ body had been lying, one at the head and one at the feet.

13 They said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping?” Mary replied, “They have taken my Lord away, and I do not know where they have put him!”

14 When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not know that it was Jesus.

15 Jesus said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping? Who are you looking for?” Because she thought he was the gardener, she said to him, “Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have put him, and I will take him.”

16 Jesus said to her, “Mary.” She turned and said to him in Aramaic, “Rabboni” (which means Teacher).

17 Jesus replied, “Do not touch me, for I have not yet ascended to my Father. Go to my brothers and tell them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.’”

18 Mary Magdalene came and informed the disciples, “I have seen the Lord!” And she told them what Jesus had said to her.

2 就跑去見西門彼得和耶穌所愛的那個門徒，對他們說：「有人把主從墳墓裏挪去了，我們不知道放在那裏！」

3 彼得和那門徒就往墳墓那裏去；

4 兩個人同跑，那門徒比彼得跑得快，先到了墳墓，

5 彎腰往裏面看，見細麻布條放在那裏，只是沒有進去。

6 西門彼得隨後也到了，直進墳墓裏去，就看見細麻布條放在那裏，

7 又看見耶穌的裹頭巾沒有和細麻布條放在一起，而是捲着放在別處。

8 先到墳墓的那門徒也進去，看見就信了。

9 （因為他們還不明白聖經的意思，就是耶穌必要從死裏復活。）

10 於是兩個門徒各自回家去了。

11 馬利亞卻站在墳墓外面哭，哭的時候，彎腰往墳墓裏看，

12 見兩個穿着白衣的天使坐在原來安放耶穌身體的地方，一個在頭，一個在腳。

13 天使對她說：「婦人，你為甚麼哭？」她說：「有人把我主挪了去，我不知道放在那裏。」

14 說了這話，她轉過身來，看見耶穌站在那裏，可是她不知道那就是耶穌。

15 耶穌問她說：「婦人，為甚麼哭？你找誰呢？」馬利亞以為是看園的，就對他說：「先生，若是你把他移了去，請告訴我你把他放在那裏，我便去取他。」

16 耶穌說：「馬利亞。」她就轉過來，用希伯來話對他說：「拉波尼！」（拉波尼就是老師的意思。）

17 耶穌說：「不要摸我，因我還沒有升上去見我的父。你往我的弟兄那裏去，告訴他們說：『我要升上去見我的父，也是你們的父，見我的 神，也是你們的 神。』」

18 抹大拉的馬利亞就去告訴門徒說：「我已經看見了主！」她又將耶穌對她說的話告訴他們。

3 Above all, understand this: In the last days blatant scoffers will come, being propelled by their own evil urges

4 and saying, “Where is his promised return? For ever since our ancestors died, all things have continued as they were from the beginning of creation.”

5 For they deliberately suppress this fact, that by the word of God heavens existed long ago and an earth was formed out of water and by means of water.

6 Through these things the world existing at that time was destroyed when it was deluged with water.

7 But by the same word the present heavens and earth have been reserved for fire, by being kept for the day of judgment and destruction of the ungodly.

8 Now, dear friends, do not let this one thing escape your notice, that a single day is like a thousand years with the Lord and a thousand years are like a single day.

9 The Lord is not slow concerning his promise, as some regard slowness, but is being patient toward you, because he does not wish for any to perish but for all to come to repentance.

3 最要緊的，該知道在末世必有肆意嘲弄的人，依照自己的惡慾出來譏誚說：

4 「他應許的再來在那裏呢？因為從列祖睡了以來，一切事與起初創造的時候仍是一樣。」

5 他們故意掩藏真相，就是從太古憑 神的話有了天，並從水而出藉水而成了地；

6 藉着這些，當時的世界被水淹沒就消滅了；

7 但現在的天地，卻是憑着相同的話存留，直留到不敬虔之人受審判遭沉淪的日子，用火焚燒。

8 親愛的弟兄啊！有一件事你們不可忘記，就是主看一日如千年，千年如一日。

9 主所應許的尚未成就，有人以為他是耽延，其實不是耽延，乃是寬容你們，因他不願有一人沉淪，乃願人人都悔改。

Jesus commanded us to tell others the Good News, to baptize those who believe, and help them to follow Him. 

耶穌吩咐我們告訴別人好訊息，給信的人施洗，並幫助他們跟隨他。

##### _Mark 16:15-20 (NET)_

###### \

15 He said to them, “Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature.

16 The one who believes and is baptized will be saved, but the one who does not believe will be condemned.

17 These signs will accompany those who believe: In my name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new languages;

18 they will pick up snakes with their hands, and whatever poison they drink will not harm them; they will place their hands on the sick and they will be well.”

19 After the Lord Jesus had spoken to them, he was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God.

20 They went out and proclaimed everywhere, while the Lord worked with them and confirmed the word through the accompanying signs.

15 他又對他們說：「你們往普天下去，傳福音給萬民聽。

16 信而受洗的，必然得救；不信的，必被定罪。

17 信的人必有神蹟隨着他們：就是奉我的名趕鬼；說新語言；

18 手能拿蛇；若喝了甚麼毒物，也必不受害；手按病人，病人就必好了。」

19 主耶穌和他們說完了話，後來被接到天上，坐在 神的右邊。

20 門徒出去，到處傳揚福音，主和他們同工，用隨着的神蹟證實所傳的道。

##### _Matthew 28:18-20 (NET)_

18 Then Jesus came up and said to them, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.

19 Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit,

20 teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age.”

\

##### _Matthew 28:18-20 (Chinese NET (T))_

###### \

18 於是耶穌進前來，對他們說：「天上地下所有的權柄都賜給我了。

19 所以，你們要去，使萬民作我的門徒，奉父、子、聖靈的名給他們施洗。

20 凡我所吩咐你們的，都要教導他們遵守，我就常與你們同在，直到世界的末了。」
