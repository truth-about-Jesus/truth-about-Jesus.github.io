# exhausted

Jesus understands and sees you. He says:

“Come to me, all of you who labor and are burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.”” (Matthew 11:28-30, TCENT)
