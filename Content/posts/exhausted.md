Jesus understands and sees you. He says:

\

_Matthew 11:28-30 (TCENT)_

28 "Come to me, all of you who labor and are burdened, and I will give you rest.

29 Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.

30 For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.‚Äù
