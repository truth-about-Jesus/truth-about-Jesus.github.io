## prologue &nbsp;&nbsp;序言

for a number of years now, i have been disconnected from my siblings, extended family, friends, and the church where i was deeply involved for most of my life.

\

多年來，我一直與我的兄弟姐妹、大家庭、朋友以及我一生中大部分時間都深入參與的教會脫節。

\
\

why?? have i fallen away from God? am i bitter and angry about something? do i have a mental health disorder? has someone wrongly influenced me against them?

\

為什麼？？ 我從上帝身邊墮落了嗎？ 我對某事感到痛苦和憤怒嗎？ 我有心理健康障礙嗎？ 有人錯誤地影響了我反對他們嗎？

\
\

what could _possibly_ be the reason?!

\

原因可能是什麼？！

\
\

take this story as a witness that the answer is: _none of the above_. instead, let me tell you the story of how Jesus has led me into the wilderness... to focus more fully on Him and learn from Him.

\

把這個故事作為證據，答案是：以上都不是。相反，讓我告訴你耶穌如何帶領我進入曠野的故事......更充分地關注他，向他學習。

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_“Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak tenderly to her._

\

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_“她卻忘記我！」這是耶和華說的。「不過，後來我必誘導她，領她回到曠野，對她說溫柔的話。 _

\
\

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_And there I will give her her vineyards and make the Valley of Achor a door of hope. And there she shall answer as in the days of her youth, as at the time when she came out of the land of Egypt._

\

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_在那裏，我必還她葡萄園，將「艱難谷」變作希望的「機會」。她必在那裏歌唱，與年青的日子一樣，與從埃及地上來的時候相同。」_

\
\

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_“And in that day, declares the LORD, you will call me ‘My Husband,’ and no longer will you call me ‘My Baal.’_

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_耶和華說：「那日你必稱呼我「我夫」，不再稱呼我「我主」。_

## into the wilderness &nbsp;&nbsp;進入荒野

Over the past seven or eight years, i’ve sensed God calling me away from social involvement. gradually, i stopped attending gatherings with family and friends. i deleted my accounts on social media. and i played — and then stopped playing — ice hockey.

\

在過去的七八年裡，我感覺到上帝叫我遠離社會參與。漸漸地，我不再與家人和朋友一起參加聚會。我刪除了社交媒體上的帳戶。我玩了——然後又不再玩——冰球了。

\
\

i came to understand that God was offering me a choice between being either social or creative: i chose to be creative. it also became more and more clear that i was an introvert, despite earlier appearances; i found this new quiet life much more relaxing and enjoyable.

\

我開始明白，上帝讓我在社交或創造性之間做出選擇：我選擇了創造性。我也越來越清楚地看到，儘管我早些過面，但我是一個內向的人；我發現這種新的安靜的生活更輕鬆和愉快。

\
\

i had always believed that the only way to serve God was by being social: by leading or teaching in an organized ministry. but i felt like God was trying to teach me that there are many ways to serve Him — even as an introvert.

\

我一直相信，侍奉上帝的唯一方法是社交：在有組織的事工中主管或教導。但我覺得上帝試圖教導我，有很多方法可以侍奉他——即使是作為一個內向的人。

\
\

\
\

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_But the Lord answered her, “Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things, but one thing is necessary. Mary has chosen the good portion, which will not be taken away from her.” (Luke 10:41-42, ESV)_

\

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_“但主回答說：「馬大，馬大，你為許多的事，思慮煩擾， 但是不可少的只有一件。馬利亞已經選擇那最好的，是不能拿走的。」” (Luke 10:41-42, Chinese NET (T))_

\

\
\

finally, almost nothing social remained on our calendar, except church on Sundays. my hubby Henry and son Jared and i were attending a small church not far from our home fairly regularly, although we had not really gotten to know anyone there as yet. i guess i was still hoping i might eventually get involved with the worship team or some other form of ministry there, since that was how i’d grown up — actively serving in the church. but it was becoming more and more clear that God had other plans for me that were outside of my expectations.

\

最後，除了週日的教堂外，我們的日曆上幾乎沒有任何社交活動。我的丈夫亨利和兒子賈裡德和我經常去離我們家不遠的一個小教堂，儘管我們還沒有真正認識那裡的任何人。我想我仍然希望我最終能參與那裡的禮拜團隊或其他形式的事工，因為我就是這樣長大的——在教堂裡積極服務。但越來越清楚的是，上帝對我還有其他超出我預期的計劃。

\
\

on December 15th, 2019 we attended what turned out to be our last service at that church together as a family. that day we were creating Christmas tree ornaments with balloons, jute and glue, sitting around large round tables with others in the congregation. because our ornaments were still wet, we had to leave them hanging up to dry.

\

2019年12月15日，我們一家人一起參加了那座教堂的最後一次禮拜儀式。那天，我們用氣球、黃麻和膠水製作聖誕樹裝飾品，與會眾中的其他人圍坐在大圓桌旁。因為我們的裝飾品仍然溼漉漉的，我們不得不把它們掛起來晾乾。

\
\

the rest of the church was going to stay for lunch, but we had other plans. Henry and Jared went out to the car while i was waylaid by one of the women inviting me to join the lunch. i explained to her that my hubby and son were waiting for me, and she graciously let me go.

\

教堂的其他人打算留下來吃午飯，但我們有其他計劃。 亨利和賈裡德走到車上，當時我被一個邀請我參加午餐的女人擋住了。我向她解釋說，我的丈夫和兒子在等我，她慷慨地讓我走了。

\
\

all that next week, i was down with the flu. i finally got better for a week, then came down with another flu for a third week. by that time we had missed all of the remaining Sunday church services in 2019.

\

下週，我得了流感。我終於好轉了一週，然後又得了流感第三週。到那時，我們已經錯過了2019年剩下的所有週日教堂禮拜。

\
\

around that time, God started to speak to me from His Word about going out to the wilderness. i didn’t really understand — not yet. but i’ve noticed He tends to get the ball rolling in telling me things i don’t understand or pick up on right away, so that later when i finally do get the message, i can look back through my journal and realize that He had been speaking to me about that for a while.

\

大約在那個時候，上帝開始從他的話語中對我說關於去荒野的事情。我真的不明白——還沒有。但我注意到他傾向於開始告訴我我不明白的事情，或者馬上開始，這樣以後當我終於收到資訊時，我可以回顧我的日記，意識到他已經和我談了一段時間了。

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_But the woman was given the two wings of the great eagle so that she might fly from the serpent into the wilderness, to the place where she is to be nourished for a time, and times, and half a time. (Revelation 12:14, ESV)_

\

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_“但是有大鷹的兩個翅膀賜給婦人，叫她能飛到曠野，到 神為她預備的地方躲避那蛇，她在那裏被照顧一載二載半載。” (Revelation 12:14, Chinese NET (T))_

\
\

<center>🔹</center>

\

i struggled with this calling to the wilderness over and over and over again. every time i asked God for confirmation, He graciously gave it. every time someone invited me to something and i felt bad once again for not being there, and i asked Him yet again whether it was really from Him, God kindly gave me another word about being in the wilderness, until there could be no question anymore.

\

我一遍又一遍地與這個對曠野的召喚作鬥爭。每次我向上帝請求確認時，他都慷慨地給了我。每次有人邀請我參加某事，我再次為不在那裡而感到難過，我再次問他這是否真的來自他，上帝親切地又給了我一句關於在曠野的話，直到不再有疑問。

\

## wait — what?! &nbsp;&nbsp;等等——什麼？！

while i was down with my first week of flu, the church sent out their usual weekly announcement email, and one item in particular caught me by surprise.

\

當我患有流感的第一週時，教會傳送了他們通常的每週公告電子郵件，其中特別讓我措手不及。

\
\

it was the screening of a video of two women getting married — to each other! i felt very troubled and concerned.

\

這是放映兩個女人結婚的影片——彼此！ 我感到非常煩惱和擔憂。

\
\

up until that moment, i had not realized that this church, which God had clearly been leading us to attend for the past five months, was pro-LGBTQ.

\

直到那一刻，我才意識到這個上帝在過去五個月裡顯然一直引導我們參加的教會是親LGBTQ的。

\
\

i didn’t have much experience or knowledge about anything LGBTQ-related. my best friend Drew in grade school had turned out to be gay, apparently, but we had drifted apart after grade 5, and i had only found out from someone else after we had both already graduated from high school and lost contact.

\

我對任何與LGBTQ有關的事情都沒有太多經驗或知識。顯然，我小學時最好的朋友Drew原來是同性戀，但我們在五年級後就疏遠了，我只是在高中畢業並失去聯絡後才從別人那裡發現。

\
\

then there had been no personal contact with anyone LGBTQ — at least, not that i was aware of — until my beginner women’s ice hockey team only a few years ago: at least three women on my team had been lesbians. one was our coach; the other two, i eventually found out, were married to each other. they were the kindest, most trustworthy members of our team, as far as i could tell.

\

然後，直到幾年前我的初學者女子冰球隊才與任何LGBTQ沒有任何個人接觸——至少，我不知道——我的團隊中至少有三個女性是女同性戀者。一個是我們的教練；另外兩個，我最終發現，彼此結婚了。據我所知，她們是我們團隊中最善良、最值得信賴的成員。

\
\

but through my times of reading through the Bible, i had occasionally come across that word “homosexuality” — and not in any positive sense. it was always in one of Paul’s lists of sins. so i honestly thought the Bible was pretty clear about such matters. i also assumed the reason God had destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah was because they were all homosexuals...

\

但在我閱讀《聖經》的時候，我偶爾會遇到“同性戀”這個詞——而且沒有任何積極的意義上。它總是在保羅的罪孽清單中。所以我誠實地認為《聖經》對這些問題非常清楚。我還認為上帝摧毀所多瑪和蛾摩拉的原因是因為他們都是同性戀者......

\
\

then there was the local Pride Parade, which i had sometimes seen televised: folks dressed flamboyantly and sometimes rather skimpily...

\

然後是當地的驕傲遊行，我有時看過電視轉播：人們穿著華麗，有時相當吝嗇......

\
\

and the news headlines — back during the beginning of the AIDS crisis, every so often some preacher would make headlines condemning gays and using the epidemic to prove that God was judging them.

\

和新聞頭條新聞——早在艾滋病危機開始時，一些傳教士經常會成為譴責同性戀的頭條新聞，並利用疫情來證明上帝在審判他們。

\
\

and then there was the issue of legalizing gay marriage: it seemed to me that most prominent, well-respected Christian leaders, like Billy Graham and James Dobson, were all against it.

\

然後是同性戀婚姻合法化的問題：在我看來，最傑出、最受尊敬的基督教領袖，如比利·格雷厄姆和詹姆斯·多布森，都反對它。

\
\

and more recently i had seen a headline about lesbians trying to drive a Christian baker out of business because he had refused to make their wedding cake...

\

最近，我看到一個關於女同性戀者試圖趕走一個基督教麵包師的頭條新聞，因為他拒絕做他們的婚禮蛋糕......

\
\

so even though my two personal encounters with LGBTQ folks were overwhelmingly positive, what i read in the Bible and saw in the news and on TV was quite negative.

\

因此，儘管我與LGBTQ人群的兩次個人接觸是絕對積極的，但我在聖經中讀到並在新聞和電視上看到的東西是相當消極的。

\
\

so... why did it seem like this church was actually promoting gay marriage?!

\

所以......為什麼這個教會似乎真的在提倡同性戀婚姻？！

## “you can learn something”
## “你可以學到一些東西”

while i was still recovering from my first bout of the flu in December 2019, i had difficulty sleeping because of a lingering cough. in the early morning hours of the 23rd, i had a dream in which i saw links to two LGBTQ websites. when i pulled something from them, i discovered i could sleep better without coughing.

\

當我還在從2019年12月的第一次流感中恢復過來時，由於持續的咳嗽，我難以入睡。在23日凌晨，我做了一個夢，看到了兩個LGBTQ網站的連結。當我從他們那裡拿出一些東西時，我發現我可以睡得更好，不咳嗽。

\
\

it seemed to me from this dream that Jesus was saying to me, “Enid, you can learn something from LGBTQ folks.” then He gave me this thought-provoking verse:

\

在我看來，從這個夢中，耶穌對我說：“Enid，你可以從LGBTQ人那裡學到一些東西。”然後他給了我這首發人深省的詩：

\
\

<center>📖</center>

\
\

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_“My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge; because you have rejected knowledge, I reject you from being a priest to me. And since you have forgotten the law of your God, I also will forget your children.” (Hosea 4:6, ESV)_

\

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_““我的百姓因缺乏知識而被毀滅；因為你拒絕了知識，我拒絕你成為我的祭司。 既然你忘記了你上帝的律法，我也會忘記你的孩子。” （霍西阿 4:6, 翻譯自 ESV)_

\
\


<center>🔹</center>

\
\

i was definitely getting the impression that Jesus was calling me out for my ignorance of the whole LGBTQ question! still, i was reluctant to expose myself to something that could possibly be a snare to me...

\

我絕對得到的印象是，耶穌在呼喚我，因為我對整個LGBTQ問題的無知！ 儘管如此，我仍然不願意讓自己暴露在可能成為我陷阱的東西中......

\
\

whenever we saw same-sex attraction portrayed on TV — usually a kiss between two women or two men — i would look away. my husband thought i was looking away because i was disgusted by sin, but in reality i was looking away because i was trying to avoid being tempted myself... a subtle but real difference.

\

每當我們看到電視上描繪的同性吸引力——通常是兩個女人或兩個男人之間的親吻——我都會把目光移開。我丈夫認為我在把目光移開，因為我對罪惡感到厭惡，但實際上我把目光移開，因為我試圖避免自己受到誘惑......一種微妙但真正的區別。

\
\

i felt there might be some temptation there. i had a vague notion — perhaps i’d heard it somewhere — that people became gay because of, well, parental failures. i definitely had experienced what i considered fairly serious “parental failures” growing up, so i thought it prudent to keep away from such temptations at all costs, as i thought i might be particularly susceptible.

\

我覺得那裡可能有一些誘惑。我有一個模糊的概念——也許我在某個地方聽說過——人們因為父母的失敗而成為同性戀。我肯定經歷過我認為相當嚴重的“父母失敗”的成長，所以我認為不惜一切代價遠離這種誘惑是謹慎的，因為我認為我可能特別容易受到影響。

\
\

and i remembered when Wendy Gritter of New Direction, a Christian ministry reaching out to gays, had spoken at our church some 20-plus years ago. she had said that she had gay friends who wanted her to consider their alternative interpretation of Scripture as accepting of LGBTQ folks, but did not go into any actual detail. since it seemed to me that the Bible was unmistakably clear on this matter, i had assumed that whatever they had to say must be some kind of insidious deception that i should definitely avoid.

\

我記得大約20多年前，基督教事工New Direction的Wendy Gritter在我們的教堂發表了講話。她說，她有同性戀朋友希望她考慮他們對聖經的替代解釋是接受LGBTQ人群，但沒有詳細說明。由於在我看來，《聖經》在這件事上明確無誤地清楚了，我以為無論他們說什麼，都一定是某種我絕對應該避免的陰險欺騙。

\
\

so my whole approach to anything LGBTQ was pretty simple: avoidance.

\

因此，我對任何LGBTQ的整個方法都很簡單：迴避。

\
\

but now it looked like Jesus didn’t want me to avoid the issue any longer! okay, yeah, probably i could learn something from LGBTQ folks. it seemed to me i could learn something from anyone — if i tried hard enough! but — didn’t the dangers far outweigh the benefits?! how could Jesus ask this of me?!

\

但現在看起來耶穌不想讓我再迴避這個問題了！ 好吧，是的，也許我可以從LGBTQ人群那裡學到一些東西。在我看來，如果我足夠努力的話，我可以從任何人那裡學到一些東西！ 但是——危險不是遠遠超過了好處嗎？！ 耶穌怎麼會這樣問我？！

\
\

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_“my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge...”_

\

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_“我的人民因為缺乏知識而被摧毀......"_

\
\

as i puzzled over this apparent contradiction, suddenly a question popped into my mind: “what if Jared is gay?” (Jared is my son.)

\

當我對這個明顯的矛盾感到困惑時，我突然想到了一個問題：“如果Jared是同性戀呢？” （Jared是我兒子。）

\
\

i was instantly highly motivated.

\

我立刻有了很高的動力。

\

<center>🧩</center>

\
\

_(i held out for as long as i could, but eventually, when the opportunity arose — i don’t exactly remember how — i did ask Jared, a little nervously, and he assured me unequivocally that he was straight.)_

\

_（我儘可能地堅持了下來，但最終，當機會出現時——我不太記得是怎麼做的——我確實有點緊張地問了Jared，他毫不含糊地向我保證他是直的。）_

## a living apology &nbsp;&nbsp;活生生的道歉

since the only person i had ever heard of being involved in Christian ministry to gays was Wendy Gritter, i did a search for her on the internet.

\

由於我唯一聽說過參與基督教同性戀事工的人是Wendy Gritter，我在網際網路上搜尋了她。

\
\

i discovered that her organization, New Direction, had morphed into something else entirely, called “[Generous Space](https://web.archive.org/web/20200810153420/https://www.generousspace.ca/our-history)". there was a “[living apology](https://web.archive.org/web/20200810154839/https://www.generousspace.ca/living-apology)” on their website for something called “ex-gay” ministry, which, as i read further, turned out to be well-meaning but apparently misguided attempts on the part of Christians to help gays divest themselves of same-sex attraction — i.e., conversion therapy.

\

我發現她的組織“新方向”已經完全演變成其他東西，稱為“[慷慨的空間](https://web.archive.org/web/20200810153420/https://www.generousspace.ca/our-history)”。他們的網站上有一個“[活生生的道歉](https://web.archive.org/web/20200810154839/https://www.generousspace.ca/living-apology)”，用於所謂的“前同性戀”事工，正如我進一步閱讀的那樣，這原來是善意但顯然是基督徒幫助同性戀者擺脫同性吸引力的企圖——即皈依療法。

\
\

really? that was a bad thing? when i had heard about it 20 years ago, i had been heartened to learn that someone was reaching out to gays. what exactly were they apologizing for?

\

真的嗎？ 那是件壞事嗎？ 當我20年前聽說這件事時，得知有人正在向同性戀者伸出援手，我欣鼓舞。他們到底在為什麼道歉？

\
\

as i read further and followed links to [ex-gay survivor stories](https://beyondexgay.com/narratives.html), i discovered that Generous Space no longer considered being gay a choice — or sin. they no longer considered it necessary for gays to try to become heterosexual...

\

當我進一步閱讀並關[注前同性戀倖存者故事](https://beyondexgay-com.translate.goog/narratives.html?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=zh-TW&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp)的連結時，我發現慷慨的空間不再認為同性戀是一種選擇——或罪惡。他們不再認為同性戀者有必要嘗試成為異性戀......

\
\

my mind was boggled. this ministry had done a 180-degree about-face! how had this happened?!

\

我心煩意亂。這個事工做了180度的轉變！ 這是怎麼發生的？！

\
\

i read through some of the [ex-gay survivor stories](https://beyondexgay.com/narratives.html). that night, December 23, 2019, i had a revelation which i recorded in my journal the next morning:

\

我通讀了一[些前同性戀倖存者的故事](https://beyondexgay-com.translate.goog/narratives.html?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=zh-TW&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp)。當晚，2019年12月23日，我有一個啟示，第二天早上我在日記中記錄下來：

\
\

<center>📝</center>

\
\

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_in the night i realized that those "ex-gay" programs weren't good because they didn't encourage honesty, they didn't treat people the way they would like to be treated, they involved judging. they weren't like Jesus. they were something else._

\

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_那天晚上，我意識到那些“前同性戀”節目不好，因為他們不鼓勵誠實，他們沒有以他們希望被對待的方式對待人們，他們涉及到判斷。他們不像耶穌。他們是別的東西。_

\
\

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_lgbtq+ people should be allowed to be honest, they should be treated with respect, they should not be judged -- just like everyone else._

\

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Lgbtq+人應該被允許誠實，他們應該受到尊重，不應該被評判——就像其他人一樣。_

\
\

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_i wouldn't like anyone to focus on "fixing me" -- i've experienced that, too. i like the way You do things, Papa God, Lord Jesus and Mama Holy Spirit. You aren't harsh like people are. You are Gentle, Kind, Merciful, Loving. (December 24, 2019)_

\

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_我不希望任何人專注於“修理我”——我也經歷過。我喜歡你做事的方式，上帝爸爸，主耶穌和聖靈媽媽。 你不像人們那樣苛刻。 你是溫柔、善良、仁慈、有愛心的。 （2019年12月24日）_

## the blog &nbsp;&nbsp;部落格

i decided i needed to read Wendy Gritter’s blog from the very beginning to understand how her thinking had evolved. i was still skeptical, but now curious to understand how it was that a ministry that had once actively promoted sexual orientation change was now apologizing for doing so.

\

我決定我需要從一開始就閱讀溫迪·格里特的部落格，以瞭解她的思維是如何演變的。我仍然持懷疑態度，但現在我很好奇，想知道一個曾經積極促進性取向變化的部委現在是如何為此道歉的。

\
\

i started at the very beginning of the blog posted on the [Generous Space website](https://web.archive.org/web/20200920132725/https://www.generousspace.ca/). the first post was dated June 3, 2008, and there were a lot of posts! this was going to take a while.

\

我從[慷慨空間網站](https://web.archive.org/web/20200920132725/https://www.generousspace.ca/)上釋出的部落格一開始就開始了。第一個帖子的日期是2008年6月3日，有很多帖子！ 這要花點時間。

\
\

i won’t pretend i understood everything she wrote. as far as i can tell, she thinks at a much deeper level than i do, quite honestly.

\

我不會假裝我理解她寫的一切。據我所知，她的想法比我深刻得多，說實話。

\
\

but i watched as her thinking gradually evolved from the [more traditional concept](https://web.archive.org/web/20200804053544/https://www.generousspace.ca/post/more-new-direction) that same-sex attraction is a problem that leads people into sin that requires repentance... to an [assertion](/disputable) that “covenanted same-sex unions ought to be considered a disputable matter” (in seven parts!) ... to “[affirming](https://web.archive.org/web/20200918062248/https://www.generousspace.ca/faq) the relationships, families, gifts, and ministry contributions of LGBTQ2+ people”!

\

但我看著她的思維逐漸從[更傳統的概念演](https://web.archive.org/web/20200804053544/https://www.generousspace.ca/post/more-new-direction)變而來，即同性吸引力是一個導致人們陷入需要懺悔的罪惡的問題......到[斷言](/disputable)“盟約的同性結合應該被視為有爭議的問題”（分為七個部分！）......到“[確認](https://web.archive.org/web/20200918062248/https://www.generousspace.ca/faq)LGBTQ2+人的關係、家庭、禮物和事工貢獻”！

\
\

wow. that was... wow.

\

哇。那是......哇。

\
\

i wasn’t ready to go that far — not yet. but it was thought-provoking to see a deep, honest thinker like Wendy Gritter change her stance so dramatically.

\

我還沒準備好走那麼遠——還沒有。但看到像溫迪·格里特這樣深刻、誠實的思想家如此戲劇性地改變她的立場，真是發人深省。

i was curious about Justin Lee but a little leery of leaving the safety of Wendy’s careful, Bible-based thinking for an unknown, unpredictable quantity. then she wrote about him again in her [November 2012 blog post](https://web.archive.org/web/20200920131125/https://www.generousspace.ca/post/how-we-can-find-unity-in-our-diversity).

\

我對賈斯汀·李很好奇，但對把溫迪謹慎的、基於聖經的思維的安全留給一個未知的、不可預測的數量有點警惕。然後她在[2012年11月的博文](https://web.archive.org/web/20200920131125/https://www.generousspace.ca/post/how-we-can-find-unity-in-our-diversity)中再次寫下了他。

\
\

curiosity won out, and after searching on his name i found myself at his website, [geekyjustin.com](https://geekyjustin.com).

\

好奇心勝了，在搜尋他的名字後，我發現自己在他的網站[geekyjustin.com](https://geekyjustin-com.translate.goog/?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=zh-TW&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp)上。

\
\

i was very curious about him; i had seen Wendy Gritter speak and even spoken to her in person, so i had an idea of what kind of person she was. Justin Lee was a completely unknown entity.

\

我對他非常好奇；我見過Wendy Gritter說話，甚至親自和她說話，所以我知道她是什麼樣的人。 Justin Lee是一個完全不為人知的實體。

\
\

i wanted to see how he spoke: did he have shifty eyes? how trustworthy was he?

\

我想看看他是如何說話的：他的眼睛有狡猾嗎？ 他有多值得信賴？

\
\

so i decided to watch his [video testimony on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJVXWimD9w0).

\

所以我決定在YouTube上觀看他的[影片證詞](https://www-youtube-com.translate.goog/watch?v=HJVXWimD9w0&_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=zh-TW&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp&themeRefresh=1&_x_tr_hist=true)。

\
\

i found him to be a sincere, bright, honest young man, a totally committed follower of Jesus who wanted to serve God and cared deeply about what the Bible said.

\

我發現他是一個真誠、聰明、誠實的年輕人，一個完全忠實的耶穌追隨者，他想服侍上帝，並深切關心聖經的內容。

\
\

and when he had discovered he was gay, in his early teens — he was horrified.

\

當他發現自己是同性戀時，在他十幾歲的時候——他嚇呆了。

\
\

wow. that was not how i had imagined gay folks to be. i could relate to Justin Lee! he loved Jesus at least as much as i did. and he had reacted as any serious believer might, upon discovering he was same-sex attracted.

\

哇。那不是我想象中的同性戀者。我可以和賈斯汀·李產生共鳴！ 他至少和我一樣愛耶穌。當他發現自己被同性吸引時，他就像任何嚴肅的信徒一樣做出了反應。

\
\

i was boggled.

\

我被震驚了。

\
\

same-sex attraction was not a choice after all. it was something you were born with. you didn’t get to decide — you got it whether you wanted it or not.

\

畢竟，同性吸引力不是一種選擇。這是你與生俱來的東西。你沒有決定——無論你是否想要，你都得到了它。

\
\

i had thought it was a sin, but now understanding that it had not been a choice for Justin Lee — that he had spent [endless nights crying and praying, begging God to make him heterosexual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_FqndcGmKI&t=307s) — i saw very clearly that it could not possibly be a sin, since there was no decision-making involved.

\

我本以為這是一種罪過，但現在明白這不是賈斯汀·李的選擇——他無休止[地哭泣和祈禱，乞求上帝讓他成為異性戀](https://www-youtube-com.translate.goog/watch?v=a_FqndcGmKI&t=307s&_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=zh-TW&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp&themeRefresh=1&_x_tr_hist=true)——我非常清楚地看到，這不可能是一種罪過，因為沒有涉及決策。

\
\

i was going to have to revamp my entire way of thinking about such matters.

\

我將不得不修改我對這類事情的整個思考方式。

## the poor and needy &nbsp;&nbsp;窮人和窮人

as i read and researched and surfed further, i discovered horrific acts of violence perpetrated against LGBTQ folks — not just the spiritual/ psychological violence perpetrated by ex-gay ministries, but actual physical attacks.

\

當我閱讀、研究和進一步衝浪時，我發現了針對LGBTQ人群的可怕暴力行為——不僅僅是前同性戀部門實施的精神/心理暴力，還有實際的人身攻擊。

\
\

like what happened to [Matthew Shepard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Shepard).

\

就像[馬修·謝潑](https://en-m-wikipedia-org.translate.goog/wiki/Matthew_Shepard?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=zh-TW&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp)德的遭遇一樣。

\
\

i began to see that LGBTQ folks were the “poor and needy” for whom Papa God showed special concern in the Bible.

\

我開始看到，LGBTQ人群是“窮人和窮人”，上帝在聖經中對他們表現出特別的關注。

\
\

<center>📖</center>

\
\

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_“Because the poor are plundered, because the needy groan, I will now arise,” says the LORD; “I will place him in the safety for which he longs.” (Psalms 12:5, ESV)_

\

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_“耶和華說：「因為困苦人受的兇殘和無助人的呼喊，我要挺身而起。我要供應他們極為渴求的安全。」” (Psalms 12:5, Chinese NET (T))_


<center>🔹</center>

\

even if Papa God had a problem with these people before, i mused, surely now, seeing how badly they are being treated, He stands with them. i know His Heart. He is not like these people so obsessed with rules that people no longer matter. He is broken-hearted over the way people are treating them.

\

即使上帝爸爸以前對這些人有問題，我當然現在想了想，看到他們受到的待遇有多糟糕，他與他們站在一起。我知道他的心。 他不像這些人那樣痴迷於規則，以至於人們不再重要了。 他對人們對待他們的方式感到心碎。

\
\

i felt heart-broken, too.

\

我也感到心碎。

## tax collectors and prostitutes &nbsp;&nbsp;稅吏和妓女

Jesus hung out with tax collectors and prostitutes, eating and drinking, loving and teaching and healing, while the religious leaders of His day stood back and made disapproving comments.

\

耶穌與稅吏和妓女一起閒逛，吃喝，愛，教導和治癒，而他那個時代宗教領袖退後，發表了不贊成的評論。

\
\

He said to them:

\

他對他們說：

\
\

<center>📖</center>

\
\

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_“Truly, I say to you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes go into the kingdom of God before you.” (Matthew 21:31, ESV)_

\

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_“你們想想，這兩個兒子那一個遵行父命呢？」他們說：「大兒子。」耶穌說：「我實在告訴你們，稅吏和娼妓要比你們先進 神的國！” (Matthew 21:31, Chinese NET (T))_

## for those tears i died &nbsp;&nbsp;為了那些眼淚，我死了

when i discovered [Justin Lee’s YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/GeekyJustin) in January 2020, i also discovered his YouTube show: _GeekyJustin Live_. the first season, "[LGBTQ and Christian](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbidsuZsGmyinfZjjBedotjOv3WPACAsA)", featured interviews with people i had never heard of before: Kathy Baldock, Matthew Vines, Danny Cortez, Austen Hartke...

\

當我在2020年1月發現[賈斯汀·李的YouTube頻道](https://www-youtube-com.translate.goog/c/GeekyJustin?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=zh-TW&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp&themeRefresh=1&_x_tr_hist=true)時，我還發現了他的YouTube節目：GeekyJustin Live。第一季，“[LGBTQ和基督徒](https://www-youtube-com.translate.goog/playlist?list=PLbidsuZsGmyinfZjjBedotjOv3WPACAsA&_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=zh-TW&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp&themeRefresh=1&_x_tr_hist=true)”，採訪了我以前從未聽說過的人：凱西·巴爾多克、馬修·維恩斯、丹尼·科爾特斯、奧斯汀·哈特克......

\

one of them, Marsha Stevens-Pino, it turned out, was the writer of a song i had sung many times when i was younger: _[For Those Tears I Died](https://www.higherpraise.com/lyrics6/f/2918.htm)._

\

事實證明，其中一人，瑪莎·史蒂文斯-皮諾，是我年輕時唱過很多次的一首歌的作者：[為了那些眼淚，我死了](https://www-higherpraise-com.translate.goog/lyrics6/f/2918.htm?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=zh-TW&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp)。

_You said you'd come and share all my sorrows,_

_You said you'd be there for all my tomorrows,_

_I came so close to sending you away,_

_But just like you promised, you came here to stay,_

_I just had to pray._

\

_你說你會來分享我所有的悲傷，_

_你說你會在那裡陪伴我所有的明天，_

_我差點把你送走了，_

_但就像你承諾的那樣，你來這裡是為了留下來，_

_我只是不得不祈禱。_

\

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_And Jesus said, "Come to the water, stand by my side._

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_I know you are thirsty, you won't be denied._

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_I felt every tear drop when in darkness you cried,_

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_And I strove to remind you that for those tears I died."_

\

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_耶穌說：“到水邊來，站在我身邊。_

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_我知道你渴了，你不會被拒絕。_

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_當你在黑暗中哭泣時，我感覺到每一滴眼淚，_

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_我努力提醒你，為了那些眼淚，我死了。”_

\

_Your goodness so great I can't understand._

_And dear Lord, I know that all this was planned;_

_I know you're here now and always will be._

_Your love loosed my chains and in You I'm free,_

_but Jesus why me?_

\

_你的天哪太棒了，我無法理解。_

_親愛的主啊，我知道這一切都是計劃好的；_

_我知道你現在在這裡，並將永遠在這裡。_

_你愛鬆開了我的鎖鏈，在你身上我自由了，_

_但耶穌為什麼是我？_

\

_Jesus, I give you my heart and my soul,_

_I know without God, I'd never be whole._

_Savior, you opened all the right doors,_

_And I thank you and praise you from earth's humble shores,_

_Take me I'm yours._

\

_耶穌，我把我的心和靈魂給你，_

_我知道沒有上帝，我永遠不會完整。_

_救世主，你打開了所有正確的大門，_

_我從地球卑微的海岸感謝你，讚美你，_

_帶我吧，我是你的。_

i had not known it at the time, but Marsha Stevens-Pino is actually considered the mother of contemporary Christian music, because _For Those Tears I Died_ was the very first contemporary Christian song!

\

我當時還不知道，但瑪莎·史蒂文斯-皮諾實際上被認為是當代基督教音樂之母，因為《為了那些眼淚，我死了》是當代基督教的第一首歌！

\

and Marsha Stevens-Pino is a lesbian.

\

瑪莎·史蒂文斯-皮諾是個女同性戀。

哇，我想。一個女同性戀者寫了那首漂亮的歌？

## where to begin? &nbsp;&nbsp;從哪裡開始？

Justin Lee also [interviewed Kathy Baldock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGuNKz65_UM&list=PLbidsuZsGmyinfZjjBedotjOv3WPACAsA&index=2) on his YouTube show, _GeekyJustin Live_. Kathy is a heterosexual, outgoing, older white evangelical — so at first it seemed odd to me that he was interviewing her, but i soon found out that she had made her own about-face from being a completely unaffirming and traditional evangelical to writing a book, _[Walking the Bridgeless Canyon](https://canyonwalkerconnections.com/walking-the-bridgeless-canyon-hub/),_ with the express intent to “repair the breach between the Church and the LGBT community.”

\

Justin Lee還在他的YouTube節目GeekyJustin Live上[採訪了Kathy Baldock](https://www-youtube-com.translate.goog/watch?v=sGuNKz65_UM&list=PLbidsuZsGmyinfZjjBedotjOv3WPACAsA&index=2&_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=zh-TW&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp&themeRefresh=1&_x_tr_hist=true)。 Kathy是一個異性戀、外向、年長的白人福音派——所以起初他採訪她對我來說似乎很奇怪，但我很快就發現，她從一個完全不肯定的傳統福音派到寫了一本書《[無橋峽谷漫步](https://canyonwalkerconnections-com.translate.goog/walking-the-bridgeless-canyon-hub/?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=zh-TW&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp)》，其明確意圖是“修復教會和LGBT社群之間的裂痕”。

\
\

during their lively discussion, [Justin asks Kathy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGuNKz65_UM&t=1262s) on behalf of a viewer: “Where would you suggest someone to start researching this academically, in addition to your books?”

\

在他們熱烈的討論中，賈斯汀代表觀眾問凱西：“除了你的書之外，你會建議別人從哪裡開始進行學術研究？”

\
\

Kathy responds by strongly recommending Justin Lee’s own book, _[Torn](https://geekyjustin.com/books/torn/),_ first and foremost, adding matter-of-factly, “and i’ve always said that.” she then goes on to recommend her own book next, and a couple of other books as well.

\

Kathy的迴應是強烈推薦Justin Lee自己的書《[Torn](https://geekyjustin-com.translate.goog/books/torn/?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=zh-TW&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp)》，首先是實事求是地補充的，“我一直都這麼說。”然後她接著推薦她自己的書，以及其他幾本書。

\
\

i was intrigued. because i was still so new to the topic, i felt like i was reading everything i could find, but still didn’t have a clear framework to help me pull together in my mind everything i was learning.

\

我很感興趣。因為我對這個話題還很陌生，我覺得我正在閱讀我能找到的一切，但仍然沒有一個明確的框架來幫助我在腦海中彙集我正在學習的一切。

\
\

sensing God’s prompting, i decided to order _[Torn](https://geekyjustin.com/books/torn/)_.

\

感覺到上帝的提示，我決定命令撕裂《[Torn](https://geekyjustin-com.translate.goog/books/torn/?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=zh-TW&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp)》。

## clobber verses and Jesus
## Clobber詩句和耶穌

Justin Lee’s book, _[Torn](https://geekyjustin.com/books/torn/),_ turned out to be an easy read. He recounts his personal story in a way that is both relatable and engaging.

\

賈斯汀·李的書《[Torn](https://geekyjustin-com.translate.goog/books/torn/?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=zh-TW&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp)》原來很容易閱讀。 他以一種既可親和又引人入勝的方式講述了他的個人故事。

\
\

after telling how he discovered he was gay and came out to his parents, he then turns to questions of why people are gay, conversion therapy and whether or not it works, how Christians treat gays, how gays feel about Christians, and finally, in chapters 12 and 13, what the Bible says about the issue.

\

在講述了他如何發現自己是同性戀並向父母走來後，他轉向了人們為什麼是同性戀的問題，皈依療法以及它是否有效，基督徒如何對待同性戀，同性戀者對基督徒的感受，最後，在第12章和第13章中，《聖經》對這個問題的看法。

\
\

at last we were getting to the meat of the matter!

\

我們終於開始瞭解這件事了！

\
\

apparently there are five passages in the Bible that appear to refer to homosexuality specifically (six that are known as the “clobber” verses because of the way they are so often used by thoughtless Christians on LGBTQ folks).

\

顯然，《聖經》中有五個段落似乎專門提到了同性戀（六個段落被稱為“clobber”經文，因為它們經常被不經意的基督徒用於LGBTQ人群）。

\
\

there is a story (the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah in Genesis 18:16 - 19:29) and a law (Leviticus 18:22; 20:13) from the Old Testament, and a brief discussion of idolatry and unnatural relations (Romans 1:18-32) and two lists of sins (1 Corinthians 6:9-10; 1 Timothy 1:9-10) from Paul in the New.

\

《舊約》中有一個故事（創世紀18:16-19:29中所多瑪和蛾摩拉的毀滅）和律法（利未記18:22；20:13），以及保羅在《新約》中關於偶像崇拜和不自然關係的簡短討論（羅馬書1:18-32）和兩項罪孽清單（哥林多前書6:9-10；提

and nothing from Jesus.

耶穌什麼都沒有。

\

as far as i can tell, the actions of some who claim to be “Christians” while attacking and mistreating LGBTQ folks, or merely trying to deny them the basic necessities of life, are in blatant and direct contradiction to the teaching and example of Jesus.

據我所知，一些聲稱自己是“基督徒”的人在攻擊和虐待LGBTQ人群時的行為，或只是試圖剝奪他們的基本生活必需品，與耶穌的教導和榜樣公然和直接矛盾。

\

在所多瑪和蛾摩拉的故事中，上帝徹底摧毀了兩個城市：

\
\

<center>📖</center>

\
\

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Then the LORD rained on Sodom and Gomorrah sulfur and fire from the LORD out of heaven. And he overthrew those cities, and all the valley, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and what grew on the ground. (Genesis 19:24-25, ESV)_

\

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_“然後，耶和華將硫磺與火，從天上降與所多瑪和蛾摩拉。這是耶和華從天上降下的， 毀滅了那些城和全平原，並城裏所有的居民，連地上生長的。” (Genesis 19:24-25, Chinese NET (T))_

\
\

<center>🔹</center>

\
\

why? God tells Abraham:

\

為什麼？ 上帝告訴亞伯拉罕：

\
\

<center>📖</center>

\
\

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Then the LORD said, “Because the outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is great and their sin is very grave, I will go down to see whether they have done altogether according to the outcry that has come to me. And if not, I will know.” (Genesis 18:20-21, ESV)_

\

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_“耶和華說：「所多瑪和蛾摩拉的罪惡甚重，控訴之聲已聞於我。 我要下去，察看他們所行的，是否盡如那控訴所傳的一樣；若是不然，我也要知道。」” (Genesis 18:20-21, Chinese NET (T))_

\
\

<center>🔹</center>

\
\

but He doesn’t say specifically what their sin is.

\

但他沒有具體說他們的罪是什麼。

\
\

but when the angels He sends in are staying with Lot in Sodom,

\

但當他派進來的天使與羅得一起住在所多瑪時，

\
\

<center>📖</center>

\
\

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_But before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, both young and old, all the people to the last man, surrounded the house. And they called to Lot, “Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us, that we may know them.” (Genesis 19:4-5, ESV)_

\

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_“他們還沒有躺下睡覺，所多瑪城裏各處的男人，連老帶少，都來圍住那房子， 呼叫羅得說：「今日晚上到你這裏來的人在那裏？把他們帶出來，和我們交合。」” (Genesis 19:4-5, Chinese NET (T))_

\
\

<center>🔹</center>

\
\

to “know” them is an Old Testament euphemism for having sex, just in case you didn’t know that. so they’re basically threatening gang rape here.

\

“瞭解”他們是舊約中關於性行為的委婉說法，以防你不知道。所以他們基本上在這裡威脅要輪姦。

\
\

that satisfied me. there was no need to look for any further sin to explain God’s action in this story.

\

這讓我很滿意。沒有必要尋找任何進一步的罪惡來解釋上帝在這個故事中的行為。

### the New Testament clobber verses &nbsp;&nbsp;新約的詩句

\

Paul’s lists of sins in 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 and 1 Timothy 1:9-10 specifically mentioned “homosexuality” in my modern translation of the Bible.

\

保羅在哥林多前書6:9-10和提摩太前書1:9-10中的罪孽清單在我現代翻譯的聖經中特別提到了“同性戀”。

\
\

however, through my research, i learned that the English translation of the two Greek words, _arsenokoite_ and _malakoi_, was controversial and unclear, and certainly not strong enough to make a sin out of something Jesus had never even mentioned. there was nothing definitive there.

\

然而，透過我的研究，我瞭解到兩個希臘語單詞（arsenokoite和malakoi）的英文翻譯是有爭議的，而且不清楚，當然還不足以讓耶穌從未提到過的東西成為罪惡。那裡沒有任何明確的東西。

\
\

in Romans 1, Paul talked about acts that were “unnatural” — but Paul also considered men having long hair “unnatural” as well. Samson (and others) had long hair because God told him to, so it really didn’t look to me that Paul was necessarily laying down any sort of universal principle by calling something “unnatural”.

\

在《羅馬書》第1章中，保羅談到了“不自然”的行為——但保羅也認為長髮的男人“不自然”。 參孫（和其他人）留著長髮，因為上帝告訴他，所以我真的不認為保羅一定透過稱某些東西為“不自然”來確立任何普遍的原則。

\
\

<center>🔹</center>

\
\

### Leviticus &nbsp;&nbsp;利未記

\

so far so good... i had not found any real evidence that God considers homosexuality a sin.

\

到目前為止，還不錯......我沒有找到任何真正的證據表明上帝認為同性戀是一種罪惡。

\
\

then i got stuck at Leviticus.

\

然後我被利未記困住了。

\
\

<center>📖</center>

\
\

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_“You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination.” (Leviticus 18:22, ESV)_

\

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_“不可與男人有性行為，像與女人一樣，這是極可憎的。” (Leviticus 18:22, Chinese NET (T))_

\
\

<center>🔹</center>

\
\

this looked pretty clear-cut to me. “abomination” sounded like something really bad.

\

在我看來，這很明確。“可憎”聽起來像是非常糟糕的事情。

\
\

i did a quick search on “abomination” in the Bible, and discovered that eating with Hebrews was an “abomination” to Egyptians, so Joseph had to eat at a separate table (Genesis 43:32). the Egyptians also for some strange reason considered shepherds an “abomination”! (Genesis 46:34)

\

我在《聖經》中快速搜尋了“可憎之物”，發現與希伯來人一起吃飯對埃及人來說是一種“可憎之物”，所以約瑟夫不得不在單獨的桌子上吃飯（創世記43:32）。出於某種奇怪的原因，埃及人也認為牧羊人是“可憎之物”！ （創世紀46:34）

\
\

that really didn’t sound so bad to me. perhaps this word “abomination” was not as absolute as i had once thought. it seemed at times to refer to cross-cultural differences...

\

對我來說，這真的沒有那麼糟糕。也許“可憎”這個詞並不像我曾經想象的那樣絕對。它有時似乎指的是跨文化差異......

\
\

then i found the following verse:

\

然後我找到了以下詩句：

\
\

<center>📖</center>

\
\

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_“If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them.” (Leviticus 20:13, ESV)_

\

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_“人若與男人性交，像與女人一樣，他們二人行了可憎的事，必要把他們治死，血罪要歸到他們身上。” (Leviticus 20:13, Chinese NET (T))_

\
\

<center>🔹</center>

\

yikes! that sounded like a much more serious kind of “abomination” — one that carried with it a death sentence!

\

耶！ 這聽起來更像是一種更嚴重的“可憎之詞”——一種隨之帶有死刑的判決！

\
\

plus, that law was surrounded with other laws against things like adultery, incest and bestiality!

\

此外，該法律還被其他法律所包圍，禁止通姦、亂倫和獸交！

\
\

Leviticus seemed like a brick wall.

\

《利未記》看起來像一堵磚牆。

## a test... of love &nbsp;&nbsp;對愛的考驗

i had come to the place where i understood that same-sex attraction was something folks were born with and not a choice at all — and therefore, not a sin, either.

\

我來到了那個地方，我明白同性吸引力是人們與生俱來的，根本不是一種選擇——因此，也不是一種罪惡。

\
\

i knew now that there are numerous Christians who are born with same-sex attraction who did not want it, who spent countless nights crying and praying to God to remove it — but He didn’t.

\

我現在知道，有很多基督徒生來就有同性吸引力，他們不想要它，他們花了無數個晚上哭泣，向上帝祈禱，希望他能消除它——但他沒有。

\
\

knowing these things led me to understand that God Himself must have created people with same-sex attraction for a good purpose. i couldn’t get around it; it had to be so.

\

知道這些事情讓我明白，上帝自己一定為了一個好的目的創造了具有同性吸引力的人。我無法繞過它；必須如此。

\
\

i knew for sure that God doesn’t make mistakes; therefore, these folks must be part of His plan.

\

我確信上帝不會犯錯；因此，這些人一定是他計劃的一部分。

\
\

but what plan, exactly?

\

但具體是什麼計劃？

\
\

as i pondered more on God’s purpose in creating people with same-sex attraction, even Christians raised in denominations which condemned them, i realized that it looked like one of the reasons was that He was exposing our hearts.

\

當我更多地思考上帝創造具有同性吸引力的人的目的時，即使是在譴責他們的教派中長大的基督徒，我意識到看起來原因之一是他暴露了我們的心。

\
\

Jesus had a serious problem with religious hypocrites back in the day (Matthew 15:1-14; Matthew 23); it wouldn’t surprise me an ounce if He still hated hypocrisy today.

\

耶穌當時與宗教偽君子有著嚴重的問題（馬太福音15：1-14；馬太福音23）；如果他今天仍然憎恨虛偽，我不會感到驚訝。

\
\

and what better way to expose it than by creating a group of people who would appear to be sinning simply by being born?

\

有什麼比創造一群僅僅因為出生而似乎在犯罪的人更好的方式來揭露它呢？

\
\

through my reading i learned that the [initial introduction of the word “homosexuality” into the New Testament](https://canyonwalkerconnections.com/forging-a-sacred-weapon-how-the-church-became-anti-gay-hub/reverend-david/) had been an error by the Revised Standard Version translation team in 1946. it was eventually corrected years later, but not before many other modern versions had followed suit.

\

透過閱讀，我瞭[解到“同性戀”一詞最初引入新約是](https://canyonwalkerconnections-com.translate.goog/forging-a-sacred-weapon-how-the-church-became-anti-gay-hub/reverend-david/?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=zh-TW&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp)1946年修訂標準版本翻譯團隊的一個錯誤。幾年後，它最終被糾正了，但在許多其他現代版本效仿之前。

\
\

had God allowed that error to occur? to test us?

\

上帝允許那個錯誤發生了嗎？ 測試我們？

\
\

if we are going to be followers of Jesus who also follow the Law, then first and foremost, we have to obey the two greatest commandments according to our Master and Teacher, Jesus:

\

如果我們要成為耶穌的追隨者，也遵守律法，那麼首先，我們必須按照我們的主人和老師耶穌的說法遵守兩條最偉大的誡命：

\
\

<center>📖</center>

\
\

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_“You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the great and first commandment._

\

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_“耶穌對他說：「你要盡心、盡性、盡意，愛主你的 神， 這是誡命中的第一條，也是最大的。 _

\
\

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself._

\

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_其次的也相倣：就是要愛人如己。 _

\
\

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_“On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets.” (Matthew 22:37-40, ESV)_

\

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_這兩條誡命，是律法和先知一切道理的依歸。」” (Matthew 22:37-40, Chinese NET (T))_

\
\

<center>🔹</center>

\
\

they obviously take precedence over all other laws — including the one in Leviticus 18:22.

\

他們顯然優先於所有其他法律——包括利未記18:22中的法律。

\
\

i had always wondered how it could be possible that people who are filled with the Holy Spirit, casting out demons, doing miracles, and more, could be called “workers of lawlessness” by Jesus, and told, “i never knew you.”

\

我一直想知道，那些被聖靈充滿、驅逐惡魔、創造奇蹟等的人怎麼可能被耶穌稱為“無法無天的工作者”，並被告知：“我從來不知道你。”

\
\

<center>📖</center>

\
\

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_“Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven._

\

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_“「不是所有稱呼我『主啊！主啊』的人都能進天國，只有遵行我天父旨意的人才能進去。 _

\
\

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_“On that day many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?’_

\

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_當那日，必有許多人對我說：『主啊！主啊！我們不是奉你的名說預言，奉你的名趕鬼，奉你的名行許多異能嗎？』 _

\
\

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_“And then will I declare to them, ‘I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.’”(Matthew 7:21-23, ESV)_

\

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_我就對他們宣稱：『我從來不認識你們。你們這些不守法的人，離開我去吧！』” (Matthew 7:21-23, Chinese NET (T))_

\
\

<center>🔹</center>

\
\

now i was sure i had my answer.

\

現在我確信我得到了我的答案。

\
\

<center>🔹🟣🔹</center>

\
\

## repent &nbsp;&nbsp;懺悔

there is so much more that could be said on this topic. and so much more that has been wonderfully well communicated by others — in books, on websites, through videos... and more.

\

關於這個話題，還有很多東西可以說。還有很多東西被其他人很好地傳達了——在書籍上，在網站上，透過影片......等等。

\
\

i’ve only told the story of how i became convinced that God is not at all against LGBTQ folks — not anymore than He is against anyone else, regardless of sexuality.

\

我只講述了我如何確信上帝根本不反對LGBTQ的人的故事——就像他反對其他人一樣，無論性行為如何。

\
\

in fact, i’m convinced that He created them for a good purpose — to show us what is in our hearts.

\

事實上，我相信他創造它們是為了一個好的目的——向我們展示我們心中的東西。

\
\

is God still against sin? undoubtedly. but being born with same-sex attraction is not a sin, since it is not a choice. and in rejecting such folks, or denying them equal treatment before the law, we are breaking the second greatest commandment: to love our neighbour as we love ourselves (Matthew 22:37-40). we are actually running the risk of being rejected ourselves when Jesus comes again (Matthew 7:21-23).

\

上帝還反對罪惡嗎？ 毫無疑問。但生來就有同性吸引力不是一種罪過，因為這不是一種選擇。在拒絕這些人，或拒絕他們在法律面前平等待遇時，我們違反了第二條最大的誡命：像愛自己一樣愛我們的鄰居（馬太福音22:37-40）。當耶穌再次降臨時，我們實際上冒著被拒絕的風險（馬太福音7:21-23）。

\
\

so if you are one of those folks who believes they must reject anyone who says they are LGBTQ in order to follow Jesus — please, reconsider. remember Jesus’ teachings and His example, and repent.

\

因此，如果你是那些認為他們必須拒絕任何說自己是LGBTQ才能跟隨耶穌的人之一——請重新考慮。記住耶穌的教誨和他的榜樣，並懺悔。

## what about same-sex marriage?
## 同性婚姻呢？

what about same-sex marriage? isn’t that in direct contradiction to the law in Leviticus — that brick wall i was unable to go through?

\

同性婚姻呢？ 這難道不是與《利未記》中的法律直接矛盾嗎——那堵磚牆我無法透過？

\
\

some Christians agree that there is absolutely nothing wrong with being born with same-sex attraction. but because of the law in Leviticus 18:22, they believe all folks experiencing same-sex attraction must either marry a member of the opposite sex, or remain celibate.

\

一些基督徒同意，生來就有同性吸引力絕對沒有錯。但由於利未記18:22的法律，他們認為所有經歷同性吸引力的人必須與異性結婚，或者保持獨身。

\
\

i have honestly come to the place where i do not have any problem with same-sex marriage. of course, not everyone will agree with me, and i respect that. but i do not believe that a loving, committed, monogamous same-sex relationship is offensive to God any more than a similar opposite-sex one is. why??

\

老實說，我來到了我對同性婚姻沒有任何問題的地方。當然，不是每個人都會同意我的觀點，我尊重這一點。但我不相信有愛、堅定、一夫一妻制的同性關係對上帝的冒犯，就像類似的異性關係一樣。為什麼??

\
\

some LGBTQ Christians believe they are called to celibacy; others are already in loving, committed, monogamous same-sex relationships. at Creation, God said it wasn’t good for the man to be alone (Genesis 2:18). Jesus said not everyone could handle being celibate (Matthew 19:10-12), and Paul said it is better to marry than to burn with passion (1 Corinthians 7:8-9).

\

一些LGBTQ基督徒認為他們被召喚獨身；其他人已經處於愛、承諾、一夫一妻制的同性關係中。在創造時，上帝說男人獨處不好（創世記2:18）。 耶穌說，不是每個人都能忍受獨身（馬太福音19:10-12），保羅說結婚比激情燃燒要好（哥林多前書7：8-9）。

\
\

i believe that the loving thing to do is to allow each person to decide for themselves whether or not they can be celibate. and if they decide to marry, even if you personally do not like their choice of spouse, respect their choice and embrace them both.

\

我相信，值得愛的事情是讓每個人自己決定他們是否可以獨身。如果他們決定結婚，即使你個人不喜歡他們選擇配偶，也要尊重他們的選擇，擁抱他們倆。

\
\

some commentators have said that the Leviticus law was referring not to loving, committed, monogamous same-sex relationships but to the [ancient practice of heterosexual warriors raping enemy combatants](https://medium.com/colloquium/wartime-sexual-violence-against-men-21ae5b15b3c) in order to subjugate and humiliate them — because loving, committed monogamous same-sex relationships didn’t exist back then.

\

一些評論員說，利未克律法指的不是愛、承諾的一夫一妻制的同性關係，而是指[異性戀戰士強姦敵方戰鬥人員以征服和羞辱他們的古老做法](https://medium.com/colloquium/wartime-sexual-violence-against-men-21ae5b15b3c)——因為愛的、承諾的一夫一妻制的同性關係在當時並不存在。

\
\

similarly, apparently the ancient cultural practice to which Paul may have been referring (which was mistakenly translated into the modern word “homosexuality”) in his lists of sins, was pederasty — a practice in [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality_in_ancient_Greece) and [Roman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality_in_ancient_Rome) culture in which older men married to women would also take a younger male lover whom they would mentor — i.e., a form of adultery.

\

同樣，顯然，保羅在他的罪孽清單中可能提到的古代文化習俗（被錯誤地翻譯成現代單詞“同性戀”）是戀童癖——在[希臘](https://en-m-wikipedia-org.translate.goog/wiki/Homosexuality_in_ancient_Greece?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=zh-TW&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp)和[羅馬](https://en-m-wikipedia-org.translate.goog/wiki/Homosexuality_in_ancient_Rome?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=zh-TW&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp)文化中，與女性結婚的老年男子也會接受他們指導的年輕男性情人——即一種通姦形式。

\
\

then there is the extremely serious modern-day problem of some “celibate” Catholic priests sexually abusing youth under their care. clearly, it must be wrong and unloving and just a really bad idea to coerce anyone into celibacy.

\

然後還有一個極其嚴重的現代問題，即一些“獨身的”天主教牧師對他們照顧的年輕人進行性虐待。顯然，這一定是錯誤的，沒有愛心的，只是強迫任何人獨身是一個非常糟糕的想法。

\
\

so celibacy has to be a personal choice, just as Jesus said.

\

因此，正如耶穌所說，獨身必須是個人選擇。

\
\

<center>📖</center>

\
\

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_The disciples said to him, “If such is the case of a man with his wife, it is better not to marry.”_

\

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_“門徒對耶穌說：「人和妻子既是這樣，倒不如不結婚！」 _

\
\

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_But he said to them, “Not everyone can receive this saying, but only those to whom it is given. For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven._

\

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_耶穌說：「這話不是人人都能接受的，惟獨賜給誰，誰才能領受。 因為有些生來是閹人，有些是被人閹的，也有些為天國的緣故自閹的。_

\
\

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_“Let the one who is able to receive this receive it.” (Matthew 19:10-12, ESV)_

## ordination? &nbsp;&nbsp;任命？

if we agree that a person who experiences same-sex attraction is not sinning by being born that way, then i don’t understand why there should be any problem with ordaining such folk to serve in the church — in any capacity.

\

如果我們同意一個經歷過同性吸引力的人不是因為生來而犯罪的，那麼我不明白為什麼任命這樣的人以任何身份在教會服務會有任何問題。

\
\

undoubtedly, every person who is elected or appointed into church leadership should be living according to the high moral standards of God’s Word.

\

毫無疑問，每個當選或被任命為教會主管層的人，都應該按照上帝的話語的高道德標準生活。

\
\

but it doesn’t seem right to me that the experience of same-sex attraction should somehow diminish a candidate for ordination.

\

但在我看來，同性吸引力的經歷會以某種方式減少受戒候選人，這似乎不對。

\
\

immorality should definitely disqualify anyone, whether gay or straight (and there is plenty of that on both sides of the fence).

\

不道德絕對應該取消任何人的資格，無論是同性戀還是異性戀（籬笆兩側都有很多這種資格）。

\
\

but not something innate like same-sex attraction.

\

但不是像同性吸引力那樣與生俱來的東西。

\
\

we have impoverished both ourselves and our churches by unlovingly excluding LGBTQ folks, to whom God has distributed spiritual gifts meant to complete us.

\

我們不愛心地排斥LGBTQ人群，使我們自己和我們的教會都變得貧窮，上帝向他們分發了旨在完善我們的精神禮物。

## epilogue &nbsp;&nbsp;尾聲

so that’s the story of how God led me out to the wilderness, and what He has been teaching me here.

\

這就是上帝如何把我帶到曠野的故事，以及他在這裡教給我的東西。

\
\

i tried to go back to the little church near our house a few times, but it soon became clear that it was no longer God’s plan for us. i have to think He sent us there just to get the ball rolling through their email announcement.

\

我幾次試圖回到我們家附近的小教堂，但很快就發現這不再是上帝對我們的計劃。我不得不認為他派我們去那裡只是為了讓他們的電子郵件公告。

\
\

although i began my research with some trepidation, i have ultimately found it to be both joyful and freeing, and am grateful to Jesus for getting me to do it.

\

雖然我帶著一些恐懼開始了研究，但我最終發現它既快樂又自由，我很感激耶穌讓我做了這件事。

\
\

the wilderness is a wonderful place to be.

荒野是一個美妙的地方。
