Seeing Caiaphas conferring with a senior advisor, Pilate paused and waited patiently, then watched as the advisor began to work his way through the crowd of Jews that had gathered, stopping to whisper to various men scattered throughout. 

看到該亞法與一位高階顧問商議，彼拉多停了下來，耐心地等待，然後看著顧問開始穿過聚集的猶太人群，停下來對分散在各地的各種人低聲說。

\

*These Jews,* thought Pilate wearily. 

「這些猶太人」，彼拉多疲憊地想。

\

He realized something was afoot, but he also knew he couldn't arrest a man for just talking to another man. 

他意識到有些事情正在發生，但他也知道他不能僅僅因為和另一個男人說話就逮捕一個人。

\

During this lull, young Lucius, seeing his opportunity at last, stepped forward deferentially and handed Pilate the note from Sophia. 

在這段平靜期間，年輕的盧修斯終於看到了機會，恭敬地走上前去，把索菲亞的紙條遞給了彼拉多。

\
\

*Have nothing to do with that righteous man,* the note read, *for i have suffered much today in a dream on His account.*

紙條上寫著：「不要和那個義人有任何關係，因為我今天在夢中為他受了很多苦」

\

Without realizing it, Pilate crushed the note in his big, rough hand. 

彼拉多無意識地用他強壯而粗糙的雙手捏碎了紙條。

\

"Yes, your Lordship?" Caiaphas' voice broke through the turbulence in Pilate's thoughts. "I apologize for the delay."

「是的，您的大人？」 該亞法的聲音打破了彼拉多思想的動盪。「我為耽誤而道歉。」

\

Through years of experience, Pilate quickly collected himself -- *where were we? ah, yes -- the customary release of one prisoner as a show of good faith --*

透過多年的經驗，彼拉多很快就康復了——我們在哪裡？ 啊，是的——作為一種善意的表現，通常釋放一名囚犯——

\

"Regarding the custom that i release to you one prisoner at Passover: the only other prisoner who can be released at the moment is Barabbas, who --" here he paused for effect, *"murdered a Roman soldier* during the recent rebellion, so --"

「關於我在逾越節向你釋放一名囚犯的習俗：目前唯一可以釋放的囚犯是巴拉巴，他——」在這裡他停頓了一下，「在最近的叛亂中謀殺了一名羅馬士兵，所以——」

\

He rose to look sternly down at the people, hoping to persuade or intimidate them to choose Jesus. 

他站起來嚴厲地看向人們，希望說服或恐嚇他們選擇耶穌。

\

"Whom do you want me to release to you today: Jesus? or -- *Barabbas?"*

「你今天想讓我把誰釋放給你：耶穌？ 還是——巴拉巴？」

\

He ground out that last name rather ferociously, hoping to make his own preference theirs. 

他凶狠地說出後一個名字，希望他們能選擇他想要的名字。

\
\

Instantly a man's voice cried out from the back of the crowd, *"Barabbas!* Give us Barabbas!"

立刻，一個男人的聲音從人群後面喊道：「巴拉巴！ 給我們巴拉巴！」

\

A throng of other voices quickly joined in, until soon it seemed as if the whole world was chanting, "Barabbas! Barabbas! *Barabbas!"*

一大群其他聲音迅速加入，直到不久，整個世界似乎都在高呼：「巴拉巴！ 巴拉巴！ 巴拉巴！」
