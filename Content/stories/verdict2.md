Pilate re-entered the judgement hall, geared up for his next encounter with Caiaphas and the Jews.

彼拉多重新進入審判廳。他已準備好下次與該亞法和猶太人的會面。

\

When he saw what the soldiers had been doing to Jesus -- the crown of thorns and the crimson robe -- he said nothing, only speaking to the guard detail curtly.

當他看到士兵們對耶穌所做的事——荊棘王冠和深紅色長袍時——他什麼也沒說，只是對衛兵簡短地說了幾句話。

\

"Bring the prisoner. We're going outside again."

“把囚犯帶來。 我們又要出去了。”

Caiaphas looked up quickly as Pilate reappeared alone. He hoped for a quick resolution to this trial that had taken all morning -- but was also prepared to persevere, and prevail in the long run, if necessary. 

當彼拉多獨自一人重新出現時，該亞法迅速抬起頭來。 他希望這次審判能迅速得到解決，這場審判花了整個上午的時間——但也準備堅持不懈，並在必要時從長遠來看獲勝。

\

"I am bringing Him out to you, to let you know that i find in Him not even one reason for execution." Pilate spoke powerfully, bringing the full force of the authority of Rome to bear.

“我把他帶到你面前，讓你知道，我在他身上連一個處決的理由都沒有。” 彼拉多有力地說話，使羅馬的權威全力以赴。

\

He gestured toward the doorway, and the guard detail, as instructed, allowed Jesus to hobble unsteadily out before the crowd, supporting Him only as much as needed. 

他指著門，警衛遵照指示，讓耶穌在人群面前搖搖晃晃地走出來，只在需要時攙扶他。

\

They had not realized their commander's attitude toward this particular prisoner, yet now they were coming to understand His innocence, and felt a little ashamed of their role in torturing and humiliating Him unnecessarily. 

他們沒有意識到他們的指揮官對這個特殊的囚犯的態度，但現在他們開始明白他的清白，併為自己在不必要地折磨和羞辱他方面的角色感到有點羞愧。

\

When they'd started to remove the military cloak and crown of thorns while still inside, Pilate had stopped them. 

當他們還在裡面時，他們開始脫掉耶穌的深紅色長袍和荊棘王冠，但彼拉多阻止了他們。

\

"Leave them," he'd said, hoping to satisfy the bloodthirsty mob of Jews outside with visual proof that Jesus had already been severely punished for His offenses against their religion. 

“離開他們，”他說，希望用視覺證據來滿足外面嗜血的猶太人群眾，證明耶穌已經因冒犯他們的宗教而受到嚴厲懲罰。

Caiaphas' eyes widened with appreciation as he took in the bloodied prisoner's unsteady, weakened, mutilated appearance.

當該亞法看到血淋淋的囚犯虛弱、殘缺不全、幾乎無法行走時，高興地睜開了眼睛。

\

Now he *knew* he'd won. 

現在他知道自己贏了。
