6 - Judas' escape 

None of the remaining Apostles resisted when Jesus came to wash their feet, even though it seemed very strange to them as well.

When He was done, Jesus put on His long cloak again and resumed His place at the table.

"Do you understand what i have just done for you?" He looked at them all kindly. 

The Apostles stared at one another. No one knew quite how to respond to His question.

"You call Me 'Teacher' and 'Lord' -- which is fitting, because that is what i am.

"If i -- Your Teacher and Lord -- have washed your feet, then you also ought to wash each other's feet."

Peter struggled inside with this disturbing statement. It was unsettling enough to let Jesus wash his feet. But... to lower himself like that? How could he, Peter -- the rock on which Jesus had said He would build His church -- wash the feet of his younger brother Andrew, or Simon, or Matthew, who had been a despised tax collector before Jesus had called him?!

Knowing their inner struggles, Jesus continued patiently.

"I have set you this example, so that you may do what i have done for you.

"This is the truth: No servant is greater than his master, and no apostle is greater than the one who sends him."

Peter could not argue with this logic. If Jesus, whom he loved and greatly admired, washed his feet, he could no longer consider such an activity beneath him, he realized -- no matter what anyone else thought or said.

"If you know these things, you will be happy if you do them," Jesus concluded with a smile.

"What i have said doesn't apply to all of you," said Jesus unexpectedly, breaking into their moment of silent introspection.

Everyone raised their heads and stared at Jesus. What could He possibly mean?

"I know those whom i have chosen. But the Holy Writing must be fulfilled that says, 'The one who shares my food has lifted up his heel against me.'"

As the other Apostles puzzled over these cryptic statements, Judas Iscariot slowly raised his eyes to see Jesus looking directly at him.

He blushed, and he wondered what Jesus was going to do to him, now that it was clear He knew.

But Jesus didn't do anything. Instead, He continued speaking generally to all at the meal. 

"I'm telling you this before it happens, so that when it happens, you will believe that i am the One."

Judas breathed a momentary sigh of relief.

Then Jesus dropped a bombshell:

"I am telling you the truth: one of you will betray Me."

Beads of sweat were now gathering on Judas' brow. Was his sudden intense discomfort obvious to everyone?

Then he saw that all the others were looking very sad -- not at him, but at Jesus. 

Clearly none of them suspected him still!

Peter was shocked and troubled by Jesus' last statement. Who of them would dare to betray their beloved Lord?! 

He gestured to John who was still, of course, right beside Jesus.

Catching Peter's gesture and glance, John knew right away what Peter wanted, because it was what he, too, wanted at that very moment.

He leaned back toward Jesus and spoke softly in His ear.

"Master, who is it?"

Jesus spoke very quietly, so only John could hear.

"It is the one to whom i will give this bread, after i have dipped it."

He dipped the piece of bread generously in the dipping sauce and handed it -- to Judas Iscariot.

As he accepted the bread, Judas noticed young John staring directly at him, looking stricken. Instantly he realized that John knew, that Peter would soon know, and that he was no longer welcome among Jesus' chosen Apostles.

He stood up from the table quickly, thinking irrationally only of escape.

All eyes turned to him, and even in his terror, Judas realized the rest of them still did not know -- not even Peter.

Jesus spoke directly to Judas now, His eyes filled with great sorrow and profound compassion. 

"What you are about to do, do it quickly."

Judas lowered his eyes, picked up the moneybag, and got himself out the door as quickly as possible, escaping into the night.
