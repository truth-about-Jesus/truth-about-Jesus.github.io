The Father watched and waited as His Son suffered in unspeakable agony for hours on the Cross. 

Michael and his legions of warrior angels were still alert and ready, but they were also starting to realize that Jesus was determined to complete this strange and horrifying mission, exactly as prophesied in the Holy Writings given to the humans. 

In the midst of their horror, they were gaining a new and deeper appreciation for their beloved, self-sacrificing, holy and true Lord and King. 

The archangel turned soberly to his second-in-command.

"He must love them beyond all measure."

ðŸ’ 

Heaven waited...

as Roman soldiers divvied up Jesus' clothes among themselves, and gambled for His inner linen garment, woven all in one piece...

as the two criminals crucified on His right and left spoke harshly to Him (although one, eventually, touched by His patience, repented and believed)...

as passersby, reading the sign above His Head -- "Jesus of Nazareth, the king of the Jews" -- mocked and slandered Him...

as the Chief Priests gloated in their victory and ridiculed the All-Powerful Son of God...

ðŸ’ 

Heaven watched...

as Jesus resisted the temptation to hate, to escape, to take revenge, but instead asked forgiveness for His detractors, enemies and executioners...

as He assured the repentant criminal beside Him of his place with Him in Paradise...

as He arranged for His youngest Apostle to take His place as His mother's son...

ðŸ’ 

At noon, Heaven turned away, and darkness covered the whole land for three hours. 

Sensing in His spirit the withdrawal of the light and warmth of His Father's face, Jesus cried out, in anguish and desolation:

"My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?"
