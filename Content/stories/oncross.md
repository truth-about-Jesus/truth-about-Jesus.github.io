邁克爾和他的戰士天使軍團仍然警覺和準備，但他們也開始意識到，耶穌決心完成這項奇怪而可怕的任務，正如聖經中給予人類的預言。

In the midst of their horror, they were gaining a new and deeper appreciation for their beloved, self-sacrificing, holy and true Lord and King. 

在他們的震驚中，他們對他們心愛的、自我犧牲的、聖潔和真正的主和國王獲得了新的、更深的欣賞。

Heaven waited...

as Roman soldiers divvied up Jesus' clothes among themselves, and gambled for His inner linen garment, woven all in one piece...

as the two criminals crucified on His right and left spoke harshly to Him (although one, eventually, touched by His patience, repented and believed)...

當兩個被釘在十字架上的罪犯在他的右邊和左邊對他粗暴地說話時（儘管其中一個最終被他的耐心所感動，懺悔並相信）......

as passersby, reading the sign above His Head -- "Jesus of Nazareth, the king of the Jews" -- mocked and slandered Him...

Heaven watched...

\

as Jesus resisted the temptation to hate, to escape, to take revenge, but instead asked forgiveness for His detractors, enemies and executioners...

當耶穌抵制了憎恨、逃避、復仇的誘惑，而是為他的詆譭者、敵人和劊子手請求寬恕......

\

as He assured the repentant criminal beside Him of his place with Him in Paradise...

當他向在他身邊的悔改的罪犯保證他在天堂的位置時......

\

as He arranged for His youngest Apostle to take His place as His mother's son...

At noon, Heaven turned away, and darkness covered the whole land for three hours. 

中午，天堂轉身離開，黑暗籠罩了整個土地三個小時。

\

Sensing in His spirit the withdrawal of the light and warmth of His Father's face, Jesus cried out, in anguish and desolation:

耶穌在靈裡感覺到天父臉上的光和溫暖正在離他而去，他痛苦而淒涼地呼喊道：

\

*"My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?"*

「我的上帝，我的上帝，你為什麼拋棄我？」
