Jesus tried not to wince as the soldiers removed the scarlet military cloak from His torn, bloody body and clothed Him again in His own bloodstained clothes. 

當士兵們從他撕裂的、血淋淋的身體上脫下猩紅的軍用外衣，再次給他穿上自己沾滿血跡的衣服時，耶穌試圖不表現出他的痛苦。

When they placed the heavy, rough-hewn Cross on His bruised and lacerated back and shoulders, He nearly cried out again, as He had during the scourging.

當他們把沉重、粗糙的十字架放在他瘀傷和撕裂的背部和肩膀上時，他幾乎再次尖叫起來，就像他被鞭打時那樣。

Yet He knew this current pain, terrible though it was, could not begin to compare with the agony He would soon experience on the Cross. 

然而，他知道目前的痛苦，儘管它很可怕，但無法與他很快在十字架上經歷的痛苦相比。

💠

Cornelius waited patiently. 

科尼利厄斯耐心地等待著。

It was becoming clear to the centurion in charge of executions that the condemned man had lost far too much blood to carry His Cross all the way to Golgotha.

對負責處決的百夫長來說，越來越清楚，被定罪的人流了太多的血，無法將他的十字架一直帶到各各他。

Jesus had already fallen five times and was currently pinned under the weight of His Cross, still struggling, but unable to get up. 

耶穌已經跌倒了五次，目前被釘在十字架的重量下，仍在掙扎，但無法站起來。

Quickly scanning the crowd, the Roman centurion noticed a tall, broad-shouldered man -- clearly a labourer -- watching intently.

羅馬百夫長迅速掃視著人群，注意到一個高大、肩寬闊的男人——顯然是一個工人——聚精會神地看著。

As soon as the man saw Cornelius staring directly at him, he ducked his head and tried to escape, but it was too late.

那人一看到科尼利厄斯直視自己，就低下頭想要逃跑，但已經來不及了。

"You there!" 

“嘿，你！”

Simon of Cyrene turned back reluctantly.

昔蘭尼的西蒙不情願地轉過身來。

"Lend a hand!"

“幫幫他吧！”

💠

Having arrived at last, Simon lowered the heavy wooden Cross where the Roman centurion indicated, then escaped back into the obscurity of the crowd, grateful to be away.

終於到達後，西蒙放下了羅馬百夫長所指的沉重的木製十字架，然後逃回人群的黑暗中，感謝離開。

The middle-aged farm labourer had never had to carry a cross for a condemned man before, although he had witnessed many crucifixions. 

儘管他目睹了許多被釘十字架，但這位中年農場工人以前從未為被定罪的人背過十字架。

Usually the condemned were hopeless and despairing, some bitter and cursing, and all physically weakened by the torture preceding this final journey to Golgotha, the "Place of the Skull." 

通常，被定罪的人是無望和絕望的，有些人痛苦和咒罵，在前往各各他“頭骨之地”的各各他最後旅程之前，所有人都因酷刑而身體虛弱。

通常，被判刑的人都是絕望和絕望的，有些人痛苦和咒罵，在前往各各他（“骷髏之地”）的最後旅程之前，他們的身體都因酷刑而變得虛弱。

This particular prisoner had been severely weakened -- yet He was neither despairing nor cursing. 

In fact, Simon had gotten the distinct impression that this condemned man -- broken though He was in body -- felt compassion... for him... for the following crowd -- many of whom had called for His death -- and even for the Roman centurion overseeing His crucifixion!

Simon had been convinced, as practically all the Jews had been when they'd seen He'd been captured and scourged, that Jesus of Nazareth could not possibly be from God. 

Now he wasn't so sure.
