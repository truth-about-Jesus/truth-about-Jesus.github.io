Jesus tried not to wince as the soldiers removed the scarlet military cloak from His torn, bloody body and clothed Him again in His own bloodstained clothes. 

當士兵們從他撕裂的、血淋淋的身體上脫下猩紅的軍用外衣，再次給他穿上自己沾滿血跡的衣服時，耶穌試圖不表現出他的痛苦。

\

When they placed the heavy, rough-hewn Cross on His bruised and lacerated back and shoulders, He nearly cried out again, as He had during the scourging.

當他們把沉重、粗糙的十字架放在他瘀傷和撕裂的背部和肩膀上時，他幾乎再次尖叫起來，就像他被鞭打時那樣。

\

Yet He knew this current pain, terrible though it was, could not *begin* to compare with the agony He would soon experience on the Cross. 

然而，他知道目前的痛苦，儘管它很可怕，但無法與他很快在十字架上經歷的劇烈疼痛相比。

\

Cornelius waited patiently. 

科尼利厄斯耐心地等待著。

\

It was becoming clear to the centurion in charge of executions that the condemned man had lost far too much blood to carry His Cross all the way to Golgotha.

對負責處決的百夫長來說，越來越清楚，被定罪的人流了太多的血，無法將他的十字架一直帶到各各他。

\

Jesus had already fallen five times and was currently pinned under the weight of His Cross, still struggling, but unable to get up. 

耶穌曾五次跌倒，目前在十字架的重壓下掙扎卻無法站起來。

\

Quickly scanning the crowd, the Roman centurion noticed a tall, broad-shouldered man -- clearly a labourer -- watching intently.

羅馬百夫長迅速掃視著人群，注意到一個高大、肩寬闊的男人——顯然是一個工人——聚精會神地看著。

\

As soon as the man saw Cornelius staring directly at him, he ducked his head and tried to escape, but it was too late.

那人一看到科尼利厄斯直視自己，就低下頭想要逃跑，但已經來不及了。

\

*"You there!"* 

「嘿，你！」

\

Simon of Cyrene turned back reluctantly.

昔蘭尼的西蒙不情願地轉過身來。

\

"Lend a hand!"

「幫幫他吧！」

\

Having arrived at last, Simon lowered the heavy wooden Cross where the Roman centurion indicated, then escaped back into the obscurity of the crowd, grateful to be away.

當他終於到達時，西蒙按照羅馬百夫長的指示放下沉重的木十字架，逃回人群的庇護所，慶幸自己能夠離開。

\

The middle-aged farm labourer had never had to carry a cross for a condemned man before, although he had witnessed many crucifixions. 

儘管他目睹了許多被釘十字架，但這位中年農場工人以前從未為被定罪的人背過十字架。

\

Usually the condemned were hopeless and despairing, some bitter and cursing, and all physically weakened by the torture preceding this final journey to Golgotha, the "Place of the Skull." 

通常，被定罪的人是無望和絕望的，有些人痛苦和咒罵，在前往各各他「頭骨之地」的各各他最後旅程之前，所有人都因酷刑而身體虛弱。

\

This particular prisoner had been severely weakened -- yet He was neither despairing nor cursing.

這個特殊的囚犯已經被嚴重削弱了——但他既沒有絕望也沒有咒罵。

\

In fact, Simon had gotten the distinct impression that *this* condemned man -- broken though He was in body -- felt *compassion*... for him... for the following crowd -- many of whom had called for His death -- and *even* for the Roman centurion overseeing His crucifixion!

事實上，西蒙有一個清晰的印象，即這個被判刑的人感到同情——儘管他身體受傷......同情對他......以同情及跟隨的人群——其中許多人要求處死他——甚至對監督他被釘十字架的羅馬百夫長同情！

\

Simon had been convinced, as practically all the Jews had been when they'd seen He'd been captured and scourged, that Jesus of Nazareth could not possibly be from God. 

西蒙確信，就像幾乎所有的猶太人一樣，當他們看到他被俘虜和鞭打時，拿撒勒的耶穌不可能來自上帝。

\

Now he wasn't so sure. 

現在他不太確定了。
