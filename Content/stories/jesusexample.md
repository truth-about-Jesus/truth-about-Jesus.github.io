None of the remaining Apostles resisted when Jesus came to wash their feet, even though it seemed very strange to them as well.

當耶穌來給他們洗腳時，剩下的使徒都沒有反抗，儘管這對他們來說也很奇怪。

\

When He was done, Jesus put on His long cloak again and resumed His place at the table.

做完後，耶穌再次穿上長斗篷，重新坐在餐桌上。

\

"Do you understand what i have just done for you?" He looked at them all kindly. 

「你明白我剛才為你做了什麼嗎？」 他和善地看著他們所有人。

\

The Apostles stared at one another. No one knew quite how to respond to His question.

使徒們互相盯著對方。 沒有人知道如何回答他的問題。

\

"You call Me 'Teacher' and 'Lord' -- which is fitting, because that is what i am.

「你叫我'老師'和'主'——這很合適，因為這就是我。

\

"If i -- Your Teacher and Lord -- have washed _your_ feet, then _you_ also ought to wash each other's feet."

「如果我——你的老師和主——洗了你的腳，那麼你們也應該互相洗腳。」

\

Peter struggled inside with this disturbing statement. It was unsettling enough to let Jesus wash his feet. But... to lower _himself_ like that? How could he, Peter -- the rock on which Jesus had said He would build His church -- wash the feet of his younger brother Andrew, or Simon, or Matthew, who had been a despised tax collector before Jesus had called him?!

彼得因這令人不安的言論而內心掙扎。讓耶穌洗腳已經夠令人不安的了。可是……就這麼放低自己嗎？他，彼得——他是耶穌曾說過要在其上建造他的教會的磐石——怎麼能為他的弟弟安得烈——或西門——或馬太洗腳？在耶穌呼召馬太之前，他曾經是個受人鄙視的稅吏！

\

Knowing their inner struggles, Jesus continued patiently.

知道他們內心的掙扎，耶穌耐心地繼續。

\

"I have set you this example, so that you may do what i have done for you.

「我給你樹立了這個榜樣，這樣你就可以做我為你做的事情。

\

"This is the truth: No servant is greater than his master, and no apostle is greater than the one who sends him."

「這是事實：沒有僕人比他的主人更偉大，也沒有使徒比派他來的人更偉大。」

\

Peter could not argue with this logic. If Jesus, whom he loved and greatly admired, washed his feet, he could no longer consider such an activity beneath him, he realized -- no matter what anyone else thought or said.

彼得無法反駁這種邏輯。 如果他所愛並非常欽佩的耶穌洗了他的腳，他不再能考慮在他下面進行這樣的活動，他意識到——不管其他人怎麼想或說什麼。

\

"If you know these things, you will be happy if you do them," Jesus concluded with a smile.

「如果你知道這些事情，如果你做了，你會很高興，」 耶穌微笑著總結道。

\
\

"What i have said doesn't apply to all of you," said Jesus unexpectedly, breaking into their moment of silent introspection.

「我所說的並不適用於你們所有人，」 耶穌出人意料地說，進入了他們沉默的自省時刻。

\

Everyone raised their heads and stared at Jesus. What could He possibly mean?

每個人都抬起頭，盯著耶穌。 他可能意味著什麼？

\

"I know those whom i have chosen. But the Holy Writing must be fulfilled that says, 'The one who shares my food has lifted up his heel against me.'"

「我認識那些我選擇的人。 但聖經必須完成，聖經說：“分享我食物的人已經抬起腳跟來攻擊我。”」

\

As the other Apostles puzzled over these cryptic statements, Judas Iscariot slowly raised his eyes to see Jesus looking directly at him.

當其他使徒對這些神秘的陳述感到困惑時，加略人猶大慢慢地抬起眼睛，看到耶穌直視著他。

\

He blushed, and he wondered what Jesus was going to do to him, now that it was clear He knew.

他的臉變紅了，他想知道耶穌要對他做什麼，因為耶穌顯然知道了。

\

But Jesus didn't do anything. Instead, He continued speaking generally to all at the meal. 

但耶穌什麼都沒做。 相反，他在吃飯時繼續向所有人籠統地說話。

\

"I'm telling you this before it happens, so that when it happens, you will believe that i am the One."

「我在它發生之前告訴你這件事，這樣當它發生時，你會相信我就是那個人。」

\

Judas breathed a momentary sigh of relief.

猶大暫時鬆了一口氣。

\

Then Jesus dropped a bombshell:

然後耶穌扔了一個重磅炸彈：

\

"I am telling you the truth: one of you will betray Me."

「我跟你說實話：你們中的一個人會背叛我。」

\

Beads of sweat were now gathering on Judas' brow. Was his sudden intense discomfort obvious to everyone?

汗珠現在聚集在猶大的額頭上。 他突如其來的強烈不適對每個人都是顯而易見的嗎？

\

Then he saw that all the others were looking very sad -- not at him, but at Jesus. 

然後他看到其他人看起來都很悲傷——不是看著他，而是看著耶穌。

\

Clearly none of them suspected him still!

顯然，他們都沒有意識到他在做什麼！

\

\
\

Peter was shocked and troubled by Jesus' last statement. _Who_ of them would _dare_ to betray their beloved Lord?! 

彼得對耶穌的最後一句話感到震驚和不安。 他們中誰敢背叛他們心愛的主？！

\

He gestured to John who was still, of course, right beside Jesus.

他向約翰做了個手勢，約翰當然還在耶穌身邊。

\

Catching Peter's gesture and glance, John knew right away what Peter wanted, because it was what he, too, wanted at that very moment.

約翰立刻注意到彼得的手勢和眼神，立刻就知道彼得想要什麼，因為這也是他那一刻想要的。

\

He leaned back toward Jesus and spoke softly in His ear.

他向後靠向耶穌，在他耳邊輕聲說話。

\

"Master, who is it?"

「大師，是誰？」

\

Jesus spoke very quietly, so only John could hear.

耶穌說話非常安靜，所以只有約翰能聽到。

\

"It is the one to whom i will give this bread, after i have dipped it."

「我把這個麵包沾完之後，就給他。」

\

He dipped the piece of bread generously in the dipping sauce and handed it -- to Judas Iscariot.

他慷慨地將那塊麵包浸在蘸醬中，然後遞給加略人猶大。

\

As he accepted the bread, Judas noticed young John staring directly at him, looking stricken. Instantly he realized that John knew, that Peter would soon know, and that he was no longer welcome among Jesus' chosen Apostles.

當他接受麵包時，猶大注意到年輕的約翰直視著他，看起來很受點。 他立刻意識到，約翰知道，彼得很快就會知道，他在耶穌拣選的使徒中不再受歡迎。

\

He stood up from the table quickly, thinking irrationally only of escape.

他迅速從桌子上站起來，不理智地只想著逃跑。

\

All eyes turned to him, and even in his terror, Judas realized the rest of them still did not know -- not even Peter.

所有的目光都轉向了他，即使在他的恐懼中，猶大也意識到其他人仍然不知道——甚至彼得也不知道。

\

Jesus spoke directly to Judas now, His eyes filled with great sorrow and profound compassion. 

耶穌現在直接對猶大說話，他的眼睛裡充滿了巨大的悲傷和深深的憐憫。

\

"What you are about to do, do it quickly."

「你要做的事，快做。」

\

Judas lowered his eyes, picked up the moneybag, and got himself out the door as quickly as possible, escaping into the night.

猶大垂下眼睛，拿起錢袋，儘快走出門，逃到夜裡。
