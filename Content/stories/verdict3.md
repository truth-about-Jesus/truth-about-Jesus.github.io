Pilate pulled himself together.

彼拉多決定不讓自己的情緒控制自己。

\

Whatever he *wished* were his circumstances had no bearing on what was actually happening *now*.

無論他想要發生什麼，都與現在實際發生的事情無關。

\

He needed to think clearly, to find a way to thwart Caiaphas' devious scheme to coerce Pilate -- and Rome -- to destroy this gentle, unquestionably righteous man.

他需要清晰地思考，找到一種方法來挫敗該亞法脅迫彼拉多和羅馬的狡猾計劃，以摧毀這個溫柔、毫無疑問的正義的人。

When he was ready, Pilate headed outside again.

當他準備好時，彼拉多又出去了。

\

Seeing the governor, the gathered Jews fell silent, waiting to hear his final verdict. 

看到總督，聚集的猶太人沉默了，等待著聽到他的最終判決。

\

He gestured toward the doorway and, as the guard detail brought Jesus limping painfully out to stand before the mob, Pilate spoke again. 

他指著門，守衛把痛苦地一拐一拐的耶穌拖了出來，站在暴徒面前。然後彼拉多又說話了。

\

"You brought this Man to me claiming that He was corrupting the people. 

「你把這個人帶到我面前，聲稱他正在腐蝕人民。

\

"Look, I have examined Him, and i find no guilt in Him.

「聽著，我審問了他，發現他是無辜的。



\

"Nor have *any* of your accusations against Him been substantiated."

「你對他的任何指控都沒有得到證實。」

\

He paused.

他停頓了一下。

\

"And Herod did not find anything either, for he sent Him back to us."

「希律也沒有發現任何東西，因為他把他送回了我們這裡。」

\

Now the Roman governor spoke with unmistakable finality.

現在，羅馬總督以無可置之的最終性說話。

\

"He has done *nothing* deserving death.

「他沒有做任何值得被處決的事。

\

"Since i have already corrected Him, I will now release Him."

「既然我已經糾正了他，我現在將釋放他。」

\
\

A voice rang out from the back of the mob.

一道聲音從眾人背後響起。

\

"If you release this man, you are no friend of Caesar; for everyone who calls himself a king *opposes Caesar!"*

「如果你釋放這個人，你就不是凱撒的朋友；因為每個自稱國王的人都反對凱撒！」

\

There were raucous shouts of agreement from the mob, who once again took up the cry, until it echoed and re-echoed like thunder: "Crucify! Crucify! *Crucify!"*

暴民高喊同意，然後又開始喊叫，直到迴聲雷鳴般地迴響：「釘在十字架上！釘在十字架上！釘在十字架上！」

\

Pilate began to perspire, as visions of Caesar receiving false reports -- and removing him from the governorship -- began to dance in his head.

彼拉多開始出汗，因為凱撒收到虛假報告——並把他從州長職位上解職的幻象開始在他腦海中跳舞。

\

"Shall i crucify your *king?"* he cried out angrily -- in a desperate, last-ditch attempt to divide the mob.

「我要把你的國王釘在十字架上嗎？」 他憤怒地大喊——為了分裂暴徒，這是一次絕望的、最後的嘗試。

\


With an icy glare, Caiaphas retorted:

帶著冰冷的眩光，該亞法反覷道：

\

*"We* have no king except *Caesar!"*

「除了凱撒，我們沒有國王！」
