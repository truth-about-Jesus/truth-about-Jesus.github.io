Admitted at last, Peter seated himself in the courtyard of the Chief Priest among numerous others, nervously awaiting the outcome of Jesus' trial.

彼得被允許進入後，他和其他人一起坐在大祭司的院子裡，緊張地等待耶穌的審判結果。

There'd been an anxious moment with the doorkeeper, who'd seemed to know John, when she'd inquired if Peter also was one of Jesus' disciples.

門口的女警衛似乎認識約翰。當她問彼得是否也是耶穌的門徒之一時，彼得感到一陣焦慮。

He'd quickly squelched that notion.

他很快就壓制住了她的想法。

Somewhere in the distance, a rooster crowed. 

在遠處的某個地方，一隻公雞在叫。

💠

While one of His closest friends was pretending not to know Him down below, Jesus sat patiently through reams of false witnesses who twisted His teachings and contradicted one another endlessly.

當他的一個最親密的朋友在下面假裝不認識他時，耶穌耐心地坐在一連連連的假證人中，這些假證人扭曲了他的教義，無休止地相互矛盾。

Caiaphas, who was Chief Priest that year, sighed. He needed the Sanhedrin -- the Jewish ruling council -- fully behind him. And he could not bring this kind of insubstantial evidence before the Roman governor, Pontius Pilate, whose permission would be required before the Jews could put a man to death.

那年擔任大祭司的該亞法嘆了口氣。 他需要猶太公會——猶太統治委員會——完全支援他。 他不能將這種非實質性的證據帶到羅馬總督本丟·彼拉多面前，在猶太人處死一個人之前，需要彼拉多的許可。

In fact, thought Caiaphas, it would be quite the coup to get Pilate himself to execute Jesus -- publicly -- through the most horrendous means: a Roman crucifixion.

事實上，該亞法認為，讓彼拉多自己透過最可怕的手段公開處決耶穌——這將是一場政變：羅馬釘十字架。

That would send a strong message to any other false messiahs who dared endanger Caiaphas' delicate compact with Rome.

這將向任何其他敢於危及該亞法與羅馬微妙契約的虛假彌賽亞發出強烈的資訊。

💠

Meanwhile, Peter was realizing with dismay that the folks with whom he sat warming his hands around the fire, were none other than the members of the very armed band he had only recently attempted to attack in the garden of Gethsemane. 

與此同時，彼得沮喪地意識到，與他坐在一起的火堆周圍溫暖雙手的人，正是他最近才試圖在客西馬尼花園襲擊的武裝樂隊的成員。

Feeling exposed, he headed away toward the porch, hoping to escape recognition and possible arrest. 

他感到暴露，向門廊走去，希望逃避認可和可能的逮捕。

He immediately regretted this move as, the moment he joined the group on the porch, the eyes of one of the servants there widened in recognition. 

他立刻就後悔了這個舉動，因為他一加入到門廊上的人群中，那裡的一個僕人就認出了他。

"He was with Jesus of Nazareth!" she gasped, pointing directly at Peter, who tried desperately to avoid her finger. 

「他是和拿撒勒人耶穌在一起的！」她喘著氣，指著彼得，彼得拼命想避開她的手指。

"What are you talking about?!" he responded roughly. "By God, i don't know the fellow!"

“你在說什麼？！”他粗魯地回答。 “天哪，我不認識這個人！”

He added several more oaths for emphasis. 

他又加了幾條誓言來強調。

Intimidated by Peter's fierce anger, the servant apologized profusely, and Peter decided to stay on the porch and join in the conversation, trusting that he had convinced at least this group of his complete and utter detachment from the prisoner.

僕人被彼得的強烈憤怒所壓倒，連連道歉，彼得決定留在門廊上加入談話，相信他至少讓大家相信他與囚犯完全沒有關係。

💠

Caiaphas sighed. 

該亞法嘆了口氣。

The final two witnesses were botching what had happened in the Temple courtyard just a few days ago, when the young rabbi had made the outlandish claim that He could rebuild the Temple -- which had taken forty-six years to build -- in just three days. 

最後兩個目擊者混淆了幾天前在聖殿院子裡發生的事情，當時年輕的拉比奇怪地聲稱他可以在三天內重建聖殿——但建造聖殿卻花了四十六年！

Even their testimony did not agree. 

甚至他們的證詞也不一致。

He sighed again, realizing he would have to use his authority as Chief Priest to induce the prisoner to blaspheme -- before the Council. 

他再次嘆了口氣，意識到他必須利用他作為首席牧師的權威來誘使囚犯在安理會面前亵渎神明。

And Pilate -- Rome's representative in the region -- would have to be convinced not with satisfactory evidence, but with the threat of a riot. 

彼拉多——羅馬在該地區的代表——必須被說服處決耶穌，不是用令人滿意的證據，而是用騷亂的威脅。

It was messy -- not neat and tidy, the way Caiaphas preferred to do things. 

很亂。該亞法喜歡以乾淨整齊的方式做事。

But it had to be done. 

但它必須完成。

💠

"You must be one of them."

你一定是他們中的一員。

Peter paused mid-sentence, staring at the man who had just spoken, a stranger to him. 

彼得在句子中停頓了一下，盯著剛才說話的人，他是個陌生人。

"Your accent shows it. You're from Galilee, too, like Him!"

“你的口音表明了這一點。 你也來自加利利，就像他一樣！”

Terrified, Peter began to curse and swear and bluster, desperately trying to convince those around him that he had never known  -- let alone followed -- His beloved Lord and Master. 

彼得嚇得開始咒罵、咒罵和咆哮，拼命地試圖說服他周圍的人，他從未知道——更不用說跟隨——他心愛的主和主人了。

At that moment, a rooster crowed. 

那一刻，一隻公雞叫著。

💠

"What are these men saying about You?" 

“這些人在說你什麼？”

The Chief Priest stood facing Jesus now. 

大祭司現在站在耶穌面前。
"Do You still have no response?!"

“你仍然沒有迴應嗎？！”

 The prisoner looked up calmly and said nothing. 

囚犯平靜地抬起頭，什麼也沒說。

Exasperated, Caiaphas drew himself up to his full stature and, invoking his authority as Chief Priest, said commandingly:

該亞法勃然大怒，站直身子，引用他作為大祭司的權威，命令道：

"I adjure You, by the Living God, tell us if You are the Messiah -- the Son of God!"

“我以永生神告你，告訴我們你是否是彌賽亞——上帝的兒子！”

Jesus looked up at him with eyes of fire. 

耶穌用火眼看著他。

"You have said it! I say to you, from now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power, and coming on the clouds of Heaven!"

“你已經說過了！ 我告訴你們，從現在開始，你們將看到人子坐在權力的右邊，在天堂的雲彩上降臨！”

💠

No longer caring what anyone thought of him, Peter fled through the gate as quickly as he could, his heart crushed as he realized he had unwittingly fulfilled Jesus' prediction that he, Peter -- the rock! -- would deny knowing His beloved Lord three times that very night...

彼得不再關心任何人對他的看法，他儘快逃進大門，當他意識到他無意中實現了耶穌的預言時，他的心碎了，即他，彼得——磐石！——會否認那天晚上三次認識他心愛的主......

💠

Caiaphas was elated. He had succeeded beyond his wildest dreams in getting the prisoner to incriminate himself before the Sanhedrin. 

該亞法很高興。他成功地讓囚犯在猶太統治委員會面前自證其罪，這超出了他最瘋狂的夢想。

Nevertheless, he put on his most horrified expression and tore his robes in pretended grief and outrage. 

但他還是擺出最驚恐的表情，假裝悲傷和憤怒，撕破了長袍。

"Blasphemy!" he bellowed. 

亵渎！ 他吼道。

"Can there be any further question? What do you all say?"

“怎麼會有問題？你怎麼決定？”

All of those present had leapt to their feet, inflamed beyond reason by Jesus' bold, shameless statement. 

所有在場的人都跳了起來，被耶穌大膽、無恥的宣告激怒了。

"He deserves to die!" they thundered as one. 

“他應該死！” 他們像一個一樣打雷。

Then the enraged elders rushed upon the execrable blasphemer, mocking, spitting, slapping and punching

然後憤怒的長老們衝向這個可惡的褻瀆者，嘲笑、吐口水、掌摑、拳打腳踢

the holy, all-powerful Son of God --

神聖、全能的神的兒子——

as Caiaphas looked on with glee. 

該亞法高興地看著。

Outside...

外部...

in the darkened street...

在漆黑的街道上…

Peter wept bitterly. 

彼得痛哭起來。
