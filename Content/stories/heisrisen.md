Although the burly, fully-armed Roman soldiers were lying face down on the ground unmoving, Mary Magdalene barely noticed them.

儘管身材魁梧、全副武裝的羅馬士兵面朝下躺在地上，一動也不動，但抹大拉的瑪利亞幾乎沒有註意到他們。

\

She was instead both captivated and terrified by the bright, white-clothed angel sitting on top of the stone, his face shining like lightning.

相反，她既著迷又害怕坐在石頭上的明亮、身著白衣的天使，他的臉像閃電一樣閃閃發光。

The beautiful, otherworldly being spoke.

那個美麗的、超凡脫俗的存在說話了。

\

"Why do you seek the living among the dead?"

｢你為什麼在死者中尋找生者？」

\

Mary Magdalene trembled and looked down. *What could he possibly mean?*

抹大拉的瑪麗顫抖著，低頭看了看。 他可能是什麼意思？

\

"Do not be afraid. You seek Jesus, who was crucified."

｢不要害怕。 你正在尋找被釘十字架的耶穌。」



\

She looked up again, her eyes suddenly awash with tears.

她再次抬起頭，眼裡突然噙滿了淚水。

\

The beautiful angel was just as dazzling and awe-inspiring as before, yet now her terror lessened, as grief surged within and threatened to engulf her.

這位美麗的天使和以前一樣耀眼和令人敬畏，但現在她的恐懼減輕了，因為悲傷湧上心頭，有可能吞噬她。

\

"He is not here; He is risen, just as He said!"

｢他不在這裡；正如他所說，他已經復活了！」

Jesus' mother, her eyes shining, gave a gasp of pure joy, but Mary Magdalene stared uncomprehendingly through tears of pain and sorrow... first at the angel, then toward the opening of the sepulchre where she had seen -- with her own eyes -- her beloved Master's lifeless body laid to rest.

耶穌的母親雙眼閃閃發光，發出一聲純粹喜悅的嘆息，而抹大拉的馬利亞卻含著痛苦和悲傷的淚水，茫然地看著天使……她看向墳墓的入口，因為她以前見過——親眼看見──自己摯愛的主人的屍體就被放置在裡面。

\

"Come," said the angel kindly to both of them.

｢來吧，」天使親切地對她們倆說。

\

He was standing on the earth now, at the mouth of the cave.

他現在站在地球上，在洞穴的入口處。

\

"See the place where He lay."

｢請看他先前躺臥的地方。」
