"I just can't understand it."

「我只是無法理解它。」

\

Cleopas looked over at his travelling companion. They were on their way back home, having said goodbye to the Apostles, who were still in Jerusalem.

克莉奧帕斯看著他的旅伴。他們與仍在耶路撒冷的使徒們告別後，他們正在回家的路上。

\

"He did miracles, Cleopas! *Miracles!* My own *mother* was raised from the dead!"

「他創造了一個奇蹟，克利奧帕！一個奇蹟！我的母親死而復活了！」

\

Theudas paused.

特烏達斯停頓了一下。

\

"How could God *abandon* Him like that?!"

「上帝怎麼會那樣拋棄他？！」

\

Perplexed, Cleopas shook his head. 

克利奧帕斯困惑地搖了搖頭。

\

"I feel the same," he answered in a low, troubled voice.

「我也有同感，」他用低沉、不安的聲音回答。

\

"What are you fellows discussing? You seem... sad."

「你們這些傢伙在討論什麼？ 你們看起來......悲傷。」

\

The two disciples had been so engrossed in conversation, they had not even noticed the stranger who had come quietly alongside.

兩個弟子如此全神貫注於談話，他們甚至沒有注意到那個悄悄走到旁邊的陌生人。

\

They stopped. Curious, gentle eyes met their sorrow-filled ones. 

他們停了下來。 好奇、溫柔的眼神與他們充滿悲傷的眼神相遇。

\

"You must be the only one visiting Jerusalem who doesn't know what has happened these past few days."

「你一定是唯一一個不知道過去幾天發生了什麼的訪問耶路撒冷的人。」

\

The stranger cocked his head.

陌生人歪著頭。

\

"What happened?"

「發生了什麼事？」

"Jesus of Nazareth was a prophet," Cleopas began slowly. 

「拿撒勒的耶穌是一位先知，」克利奧帕斯慢慢地說道。

\

"He spoke powerfully and did amazing miracles -- before God and all the people.

「他說話有力，在上帝和所有人面前創造了驚人的奇蹟。

\

"But the chief priests and our elders... condemned Him -- to death... and had Him -- crucified."

「但祭司長和我們的長老......判他——處死......並把他——釘在十字架上。」

\

The tears sprang to Cleopas' eyes once more, as he struggled to compose himself. 

克莉歐帕斯努力使自己平靜下來，淚水再次湧上他的眼眶。

\

"We had been hoping... that... He was the One -- who would -- redeem Israel..." 

「我們一直希望......那個...... 他是那個——會——救贖以色列的人......」

\

His voice broke; he could not continue. 

他的聲音沙啞；他無法繼續下去。

\

As the stranger waited, Theudas took up the story. 

當陌生人等待時，特烏達斯接手了這個故事。

\

"That was three days ago. 

「那是三天前的事了。

\

"This morning, some of our women went to the tomb early and came back saying His body was gone, and that they'd seen an angel who'd told them He was *alive!*

「今天早上，我們的一些女人很早就去了墳墓，然後回來說他的屍體不見了，她們看到了一個天使，他告訴她們他還活著！

\

"One even claimed to have spoken with the Master *Himself!"*

「有一位女士甚至聲稱自己曾與大師本人交談過！」

\

Theudas stopped as he relived the unsettling incident.

特烏達斯在重溫這一令人不安的事件時停了下來。

\

"Some of us went to the tomb -- and found His body missing, as the women had said -- but they didn't see Him -- and...  well..."

「我們中的一些人去了墳墓——發現他的屍體不見了，正如婦女們所說——但她們沒有看到他——而且......嗯......」

\

He shook his head uncertainly. 

他不確定地搖了搖頭。

\

"We don't know *what* to think."

「我們不知道該怎麼想。」
