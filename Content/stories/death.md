"I thirst."

「我渴了。｣

\

Hearing Jesus' plea, one of the bystanders ran and dipped a sponge into a nearby stone jar of wine vinegar. Placing it on top of a reed, he held it up to the dying Man's lips.

聽到耶穌的懇求，其中一個旁觀者跑來，把海綿浸在附近的酒醋石罐裡。 他把它放在蘆覦上，把它舉到垂死的人的嘴唇上。

\

As Jesus finished drinking what little He could of the sharp-tasting liquid, His Father in Heaven thundered at last:

當耶穌喝完他能喝到的少量味道尖銳的液體時，他的天父終於雷鳴般地響起：

\

*"Enough!"*

「夠了！｣

\

The Son sensed His Father's decree in His spirit, and knew immediately that, finally and conclusively, every last sin of humanity had been fully requited in His ravaged body, and He was now released from this torturous physical life.

兒子在他的精神中感知到他父親的法令，並立即知道，最終和確鑿地知道，人類最後的每一個罪孽都已在他被蹂躪的身體中得到了充分的回應，他現在從這種折磨人的肉體生活中解放出來。

\

"It is finished." 

「它完成了。｣

\

He sighed with relief, then turned His gaze Heavenward, calling in a loud, joyful voice:

他鬆了一口氣，然後把目光轉向天堂，用響亮而快樂的聲音呼喚：

\

"Father, into Your Hands i commit My spirit!"

「父親，我把我的精神託付給你！」

As Jesus' untethered spirit left His body hanging lifeless on the Cross, the earth shook powerfully and massive rocks split apart, terrifying Jew and Gentile alike, who ran for cover.

當耶穌獲得自由的靈魂離開仍然掛在十字架上的屍體時，大地劇烈震動，巨石裂開，猶太人和外邦人都驚恐地逃往避難所。

\

Cornelius, the centurion in charge of executions, was in awe.

負責行刑的百夫長哥尼流感到敬畏。

\

He spoke without realizing it.

他在不意識到的情況下說話了。

\

"Truly this Man was the Son of God!"

「這個人確實是上帝的兒子！」

Caiaphas was in the Temple preparing for the Passover, having lost interest in mocking the Galilean after several hours.

該亞法嘲笑加利利人幾個小時後，失去了興趣。現在他正在聖殿裡為逾越節做準備。

\

He had expected Jesus, once suspended on the cross in unbearable agony, to lose His composure and curse the God He called His Father, but that hadn't happened.

他本以為耶穌曾經在難以忍受的痛苦中被吊在十字架上，會失去鎮定，詛咒他稱之為父親的上帝，但這並沒有發生。

\

When that disconcerting darkness had fallen over the whole land, he'd suddenly remembered some things he needed to do at the Temple -- by torchlight, of course...

當那令人不安的黑暗籠罩著整個土地時，他突然想起了他在聖殿需要做的一些事情——當然，在火炬下......

\

Suddenly the entire structure shook violently. There was a loud ripping sound behind him.

突然間，整個結構劇烈搖晃。 他身後有一聲巨響的撕裂聲。

\

Caiaphas turned slowly -- then gaped, dumbfounded.

該亞法慢慢轉過身來，張大了嘴，目瞪口呆。

\

The beautiful linen veil separating the Holy Place from the Holy of Holies -- where the Ark of the Covenant had been kept in ancient times -- had been torn completely in two.

將聖地與聖所（在古代儲存約櫃的地方）隔開的美麗亞麻面紗被完全撕成兩部分。
