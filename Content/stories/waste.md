Mary waited patiently. 

馬利亞耐心地等待著。

\

Jesus and His chosen Apostles were eating dinner together with her beloved brother, Lazarus, laughing and talking, enjoying the sumptuous food Martha had so skillfully prepared, and the excellent wine Lazarus had provided. 

耶穌和祂所揀選的使徒正在與她心愛的弟弟拉撒路共進晚餐，有說有笑，享受著馬大精心準備的豐盛食物和拉撒路提供的優質葡萄酒。

\

They were all so very special, each in their own way. 

他們都很特別，每個人都有自己的方式。

\

\
\

She gripped the ornate bottle of costly aromatic ointment tightly as she waited, remembering how proudly her brother had bestowed it upon her the year the vineyard had produced a bumper crop. 

在等待的過程中，她手裡拿著那瓶精緻的昂貴香膏，回想起在葡萄園豐收的那一年，她哥哥多麼自豪地把它送給了她。

\

She hoped he would not be too upset. 

她希望他不會太難過。

\

But she had nothing else to give.

但她沒有別的東西可以給。

\

<center>💠</center>

\
\

And something inside urged her to do it. The rumours were that the authorities in Jerusalem wanted to kill Jesus. 

裡面的東西促使她這樣做。 謠言說耶路撒冷當局想殺死耶穌。

\

And Jesus Himself had said... had said...

耶穌自己也說過...... 他說過......

\

She couldn't allow herself to think of what Jesus had said. She *couldn't*.

她無法讓自己去想耶穌說了什麼。 她不能。

\

It had to be done tonight. This might be her last chance to give Jesus back just a little of what He had given her. 

她今晚必須這麼做。 這可能是她將耶穌所賜給她的一點回報給耶穌的最後機會。

\

<center>💠</center>

\
\

As she waited hopefully, she remembered the first time Jesus had come over for dinner. 

當她滿懷希望地等待時，她想起了耶穌第一次過來吃晚飯的時候。

\

He was so mesmerizing... His teaching, His words... His kindness...

他太令人著迷了...... 他的教導，他的話...... 他的善良......

\

All she could do was sit at His feet and drink in His every word... even though it had made Martha very angry... preparing the dinner by herself...

她所能做的就是坐在他腳邊，聆聽他的每一句話…… 儘管這讓馬大很生氣…… 獨自做晚餐……

\

No one else had ever talked like Jesus, and Mary was pretty sure no one else ever would. He was so very special, one of a kind…

沒有其他人像耶穌一樣說話，馬利亞很確定沒有人會說話。 他非常特別，是種類的......

\

<center>💠</center>

\
\

She remembered how her heart had burst when her beloved brother had died. And how Jesus had called Lazarus out of the tomb, healthy and alive and full of love, after four days.

她記得當她心愛的哥哥去世時，她的心是多麼的傷心。 四天后，耶穌把健康、活潑、充滿愛心的拉撒路從墳墓裡叫了出來。

\

*Four days! *

四天！

\

She could never repay…

她永遠無法報答......

\

<center>💠</center>

\
\

And after tonight, Jesus might be going away forever.

今晚之後，耶穌可能會永遠離開。

\

He'd said... and there were rumours... and...

他說...... 還有謠言...... 還有......

\

Suddenly unable to wait any longer, she felt herself rushing toward her beloved Lord, no longer caring what any of them thought of her. She broke open her precious bottle, and poured all that exquisite fragrance -- everything she owned -- on Jesus' head...

突然無法再等了，她覺得自己衝向她心愛的主，不再關心他們中的任何人對她的看法。 她打開她珍貴的瓶子，把所有精緻的香味——她擁有的一切——都倒在耶穌的頭上......

\

Lazarus leapt up to stop her -- too late!

拉撒路跳起來阻止她——太晚了！

\

Martha cried out “oh!” -- her eyes stricken with embarrassment for her normally quiet little sister  --

馬大大喊，「喔！」——為她平時安靜的妹妹感到尷尬——

\

The rest of the guests, as the outrage of what this crazy, useless girl had done began to sink in, reacted with sharp displeasure...

當人們開始對這個瘋狂垃圾女孩的行為感到震驚的時候，其他嘉賓卻表現出了強烈的不滿……

\

Mary dropped to her knees, and tears filled her eyes, as the deluge of disapproval filling the room alongside the scent of the wasted perfume, began to overwhelm her gentle, sensitive heart...

馬利亞跪倒在地，眼裡充滿了淚水，房間裡充滿了不以為然的聲音和廢棄香水的味道，開始淹沒她溫柔敏感的心……

\
\

One of the chosen Apostles spoke up with a stony glare:

一名被選中的使徒目光冰冷地說：

\

“Why this waste? That perfume could have fetched an exorbitant price in the marketplace!”

「為什麼這麼浪費？ 那種香水可能會在市場上賣到高昂的價格！」

\

As all eyes turned on him, Judas Iscariot felt his face growing hot --

當所有人的目光都轉向他時，加略人猶大覺得他的臉越來越熱了——

\

“And that money could have been given to the poor!” he finished quickly, without missing a beat. 

「這些錢本來可以送給窮人！」 他又快又順利地完成了。

\

The nods and murmurs of assent told him he was still well-concealed.

其他客人的點頭和低聲表示同意，讓他知道自己仍然隱藏得很好。

\

Jesus looked at him intently, and suddenly, Judas didn't feel quite so certain of his concealment. 

耶穌專注地看著他，猶大突然不確定自己是否隱藏得很好。

\

<center>💠</center>

\
\

Visions of the many times he had dipped into the communal moneybag -- entrusted to him expressly by Jesus -- which just goes to show how much Jesus knows! -- floated before his eyes and made him feel uncomfortably angry.

他有多個異象，從耶穌特別託付給他的錢包裡拿錢——這表明耶穌一無所知！ -這些景象讓他感到不舒服和憤怒。

\

*He* was used to the finer things in life. This ragtag band of blue collar workers -- fishermen and farmers -- *Jesus Himself was only a carpenter, after all!* -- didn't miss anything, giving up everything to follow Jesus, but *he* couldn't get by without at least a few of the more expensive delicacies once in a while...

他已經習慣了生活中美好的事物。 這些藍領階級──漁民和農民──耶穌本人畢竟只是木匠！ ——當他們放棄一切來跟隨耶穌時，他們並沒有錯過任何東西，但他不同了。 他偶爾也需要吃一些比較貴的美食……

\

Sometimes he wondered why he even bothered...

有時他想知道為什麼他要這麼麻煩……

\

But then, Jesus *had* handpicked him and entrusted the moneybag to him. What could Jesus possibly know? And no one could deny that this unbelievably popular teacher attracted some rather generous donations...

但是，耶穌親自挑選了他，並將錢包託付給他。 耶穌可能知道什麼？ 沒有人可以否認這位非常受歡迎的老師已經吸引了一些相當慷慨的捐款……

\
\

“Why are you giving her grief?” 

「為什麼生她的氣？」

\

Jesus' simple question broke through Judas' train of thought.

耶穌的簡單問題突破了猶大的思路。

\

“She has done something special for Me. The poor are always with you, but you don't always have Me.”

「她為我做了一些特別的事情。窮人總是和你在一起，但你並不總是有我。」

\

“She is anointing Me for My burial.”

「她正在為我的埋葬膏膏。」

\

Everyone gasped at this troubling statement. Even Judas.

聽到這令人不安的言論，所有人都倒抽一口氣。 連猶大也倒抽了一口氣。

\

“This is the truth: wherever this good news is proclaimed in the whole world, what Mary has done will also be spoken of -- in memory of her.”

「這是事實：無論全世界在哪裡宣佈這個好訊息，馬利亞的所作所為也會被提及——以紀念她。」

\

<center>💠</center>

\
\

Jesus' approving words pierced Mary's despair like a ray of sunlight breaking through thick, dark clouds.

耶穌贊成的話語刺穿了馬利亞的絕望，就像一缕陽光穿過厚厚的烏雲。

\

She turned her desolate, tear-filled eyes up to meet His warm generous ones, and soon the kindness radiating from His beautiful countenance was comforting and restoring her distraught soul.

她抬起那雙落滿淚水的雙眸，對上了他溫暖寬厚的雙眸，很快，他美麗的容顏上所散發出的慈愛，就讓她憂傷的心靈得到了安慰和恢復。

\

It had all been worth it. 

這一切都是值得的。

\

And Mary was glad.

馬利亞很高興。
