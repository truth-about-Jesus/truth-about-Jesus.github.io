Jesus waited patiently in the midst of the armed band that had brought Him here, to the governor's mansion. 

耶穌在把他帶到這裡的武裝團夥中耐心地等待著，來到總督的豪宅。

\

Even though it was customary to actually enter the judgement hall in order to request a judgement from Pilate, all the Jews chose to remain outside, not wanting to defile themselves by entering a Gentile dwelling before Passover, which was imminent. 

儘管習慣上實際進入審判大廳是為了請求彼拉多做出判決，但所有猶太人都選擇留在外面，不想在即將到來的逾越節前進入外邦人住所來玷汙自己。

\

Every so often, one of the band cursed at the prisoner, or shoved Him, as if trying to re-emphasize His condemned status. 

每隔一段時間，其中一個樂隊就會咒罵囚犯，或推他，好像試圖重新強調他的被定罪地位。

\

They had conveniently forgotten Jesus' display of power in the garden, and were taking their cue now from the chief priests and elders, who looked on approvingly.

他們方便地忘記了耶穌在花園裡展示的權力，現在正在從祭司長和長老那裡得到提示，他們贊成地看著。

\

It didn't matter. 

沒關係。

\

The purpose for which the display of power had been given was now accomplished. 

賦予權力展示的目的現在已經實現了。

\

All of Jesus' chosen Apostles were safe. 

所有耶穌拣選的使徒都是安全的。

Jesus had known Peter and John had followed Him to the hall of the Chief Priest.

耶穌知道彼得和約翰跟著他到了大祭司的大廳。

\

He also knew their greatest danger of being arrested had passed, although Peter in particular had not yet realized it. 

他還知道他們被逮捕的最大危險已經過去，儘管彼得特別沒有意識到這一點。

\

He was sorry for Peter's ordeal. But his self-confidence and presumption had to be exposed for the foolishness and unbelief they were. 

他為彼得的磨難感到抱歉。 但他的自信和自以為是必須暴露出來，因為他們的愚蠢和不信。

\

They needed to be replaced by a faith grounded in truth -- 

他們需要被基於真理的信念所取代——

\

before Peter could become the "rock" Jesus had prophesied. 

在彼得成為耶穌預言的「岩石」之前。

Judas Iscariot had been there, also, but Jesus knew -- had known from the very beginning -- that he was not, and never could be, truly His disciple. 

加略人猶大也在那裡，但耶穌從一開始就知道，他不是，也永遠不可能成為真正的門徒。

\

Judas Iscariot had another master, who was, at this very moment, Jesus knew with infinite sadness, leading him down to death. 

加略人猶大還有另一個主人。耶穌帶著無限的悲傷知道，就在這時，猶大的另一位主人正在帶領他走向死亡。


\

Yet that was the purpose for which Judas had been created. 

然而，這就是猶大被創造的目的。

\

Each one of them had their role to play -- Jesus included -- so that the Holy Writings might be fulfilled. 

他們每個人都可以扮演自己的角色——包括耶穌——以便完成聖經。
