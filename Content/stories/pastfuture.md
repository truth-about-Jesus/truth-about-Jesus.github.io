The Father watched in agony as His Beloved Son, with whom He had created the universe and everything in it, submitted Himself fully to the cruel indignities of a Roman crucifixion.

\

They had chosen this specific form of execution together, because it was, across all human history -- past, present and future -- the most diabolical combination of physical, emotional and mental suffering ever devised by the beloved and precious -- yet evil and doomed -- tiny human creatures.

\

It was the only way to save them.

\

Michael stood, battle-ready, at the head of twelve legions of warrior angels, each gripping their weapons and poised to intervene.

\

It was difficult for the archangel to see his highly revered Lord and King being tortured and completely humiliated -- by His own, much-loved creation, no less!

\

As soon as Jesus gave the signal, they would swoop down and rescue Him from the myriads of demons surrounding Him, who were gloating and mocking and revelling in every moment of His horrific ordeal.

\

But the signal never came.

As the gleeful demons piled high on Him all the sins of the entire world -- past, present and future -- Jesus groaned in agony. 

\

His raw, bloodied back was down now, against the rough, unfinished wood of the Cross, causing a fiery pain, while the Romans drove their sharp nails through His outstretched wrists, fixing them to the wood below. 

\

The impassive soldiers had briskly and efficiently stripped Him of His clothes, forced Him down onto the Cross, and stretched out His arms into this vulnerable, exposed position -- the last He would ever know in this fragile, physical life --

\

then hoisted Him high, pulling His bones out of joint, racking His entire frame with the unrelenting pain of multiple skeletal dislocations.

\

The Son of God was now naked and exposed and utterly dishonoured, for all the world to see.
