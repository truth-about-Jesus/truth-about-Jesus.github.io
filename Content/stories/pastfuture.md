The Father watched in agony as His Beloved Son, with whom He had created the universe and everything in it, submitted Himself fully to the cruel indignities of a Roman crucifixion.

天父痛苦地看著他心愛的兒子。他們一起創造了宇宙和其中的一切。現在，他的兒子允許羅馬人殘酷地羞辱他並將他釘死在十字架上。

\

They had chosen this specific form of execution together, because it was, across all human history -- past, present and future -- the most diabolical combination of physical, emotional and mental suffering ever devised by the beloved and precious -- yet evil and doomed -- tiny human creatures.

他們共同選擇了這種特殊的執行方法。縱觀整個人類歷史——過去、現在和未來——釘十字架是有史以來最殘酷的身體、情感和精神痛苦的結合，這些痛苦是由可愛和珍貴的微小人類所設計的——但也是邪惡和注定的。

\

It was the only way to save them. 

這是拯救他們的唯一方法。

Michael stood, battle-ready, at the head of twelve legions of warrior angels, each gripping their weapons and poised to intervene.

米迦勒站在十二個戰士天使軍團的最前面，做好了戰鬥的準備，每個天使都拿著武器，準備介入。

\

It was difficult for the archangel to see his highly revered Lord and King being tortured and completely humiliated -- by His own, much-loved creation, no less!

對於大天使來說，很難看到他備受尊敬的主和國王被折磨和完全羞辱——被他自己深受喜愛的創造物折磨和徹底羞辱！

\

As soon as Jesus gave the signal, they would swoop down and rescue Him from the myriads of demons surrounding Him, who were gloating and mocking and revelling in every moment of His horrific ordeal.

無數的惡魔將他包圍。他們幸災樂禍、嘲笑他、陶醉於他所遭受的可怕磨難的每一刻。但耶穌一發出訊號，戰士天使就會俯衝下來營救他。

\

But the signal never came.

但訊號從未到來。

As the gleeful demons piled high on Him all the sins of the entire world -- past, present and future -- Jesus groaned in agony. 

當快樂的魔鬼將世上所有的罪孽——過去的、現在的和未來的——都堆在耶穌身上時，耶穌痛苦地呻吟著。

\

His raw, bloodied back was down now, against the rough, unfinished wood of the Cross, causing a fiery pain, while the Romans drove their sharp nails through His outstretched wrists, fixing them to the wood below. 

他生的、血淋淋的背部現在倒在十字架的粗糙、未完成的木頭上，造成了火熱的疼痛，而羅馬人則用他們鋒利的釘子穿過他伸出的手腕，把它們固定在下面的木頭上。

\

The impassive soldiers had briskly and efficiently stripped Him of His clothes, forced Him down onto the Cross, and stretched out His arms into this vulnerable, exposed position -- the last He would ever know in this fragile, physical life --

就在不久前，殘暴的士兵迅速而有效地剝去了他的衣服。然後他們把他推到十字架上，把他的手臂伸到這個脆弱、暴露的位置——這是他在這個脆弱的肉體生命中所知道的最後一個位置——

\

then hoisted Him high, pulling His bones out of joint, racking His entire frame with the unrelenting pain of multiple skeletal dislocations.

然後他們將他高高舉起，將他的骨頭從關節中拉出來，使他的整個身體承受著多處骨骼關節脫位的持續疼痛。

\

The Son of God was now naked and exposed and utterly dishonoured, for all the world to see. 

上帝的兒子現在赤身裸體，暴露，完全蒙羞，讓全世界都能看到。
