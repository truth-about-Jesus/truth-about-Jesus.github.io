Mary Magdalene was running almost effortlessly --

抹大拉的瑪麗幾乎毫不費力地奔跑著——

\

feeling lighter than air. 

感覺比空氣更輕。

\

Jesus -- her beloved Lord *Himself!* -- had come to her -- *alive!* -- and *spoken* with her!

耶穌——她心愛的主本人！——來到她身邊——活著！——並與她交談！

\

He'd given her a message for the Apostles.

他請她向使徒們傳達一個訊息。

\

She couldn't *wait* to tell them!

她不想等著告訴他們！

\
\

*What...?*

嗯...？

\

The grieving Apostles gaped numbly at the unnervingly exuberant female who was laughing and crying and talking -- all at the same time.

悲傷的使徒們目瞪口呆地看著這位令人不安的旺盛女性，她同時又笑又哭又說話——所有這些都是如此。

\

"Jesus is *alive!* I -- i *saw* Him!"

「耶穌活著！ 我——我看見他了！」

\

Peter shook his head heavily as Mary Magdalene babbled on about "Galilee" and "ascending"...

當抹大拉的瑪麗喋喋不休地談論「加利利」和「上升」時，彼得悲傷地搖了搖頭......

\

Evidently the Lord's death had been too much for her fragile female psyche...

顯然，主的死對她脆弱的女性心態來說太過分了......

\

And now the loss of His body had pushed her *right* over the edge.

如今，失去他的身體讓她陷入了瘋狂的邊緣。

\
\

"He's *alive,* Peter! I *saw* Him! I -- i *touched* Him! It really *was* Him! He said..."

「他還活著，彼得！我看到他了！我摸到他了！真的是他！他說…」

\

She had truly lost her mind and was accosting him directly now!

她真的是瘋了，現在竟然直接跟他對峙！

\

As Mary's eyes searched his, all Peter's shame, regret and devastation welled up without warning.

當瑪麗的目光搜尋著他的眼睛時，彼得所有的羞恥、悔恨和沮喪都毫無預警地湧了上來。

\

Covering his face, he turned... 

他捂著臉，轉過身來......

\

and walked away.

然後就走開了。
