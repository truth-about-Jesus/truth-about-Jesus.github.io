John's eyes widened with horror as His beloved Lord -- beaten, bloody, and bruised -- was brought out a second time from the Roman governor's judgement hall.

當他心愛的主——被毆打、流血和瘀傷——第二次從羅馬總督的審判大廳被帶出來時，約翰的眼睛驚恐地睜大了眼睛。

\

Beside him, Jesus' mother Mary shuddered and covered her face; without thinking, John put his arm around her protectively. 

在他身邊，耶穌的母親瑪麗顫抖著，遮住了她的臉；約翰不假思索地用胳膊摟住她，保護著她。

\

Mary Magdalene stood beside her, speechless and gaping, a river of tears streaming from her eyes, as she saw her Master, Jesus -- the kindest and most compassionate man she had ever met -- struggling to walk, with cruel, sharp thorns shaped into the mockery of a crown forced down upon His head. 

抹大拉的瑪麗站在她身邊，無言以對，目瞪口呆，眼淚從她的眼睛裡流了出來，她看到她的主人耶穌——她見過的最善良、最富有同情心的人——掙扎著走路，殘忍、殘酷而尖銳的荊棘被塑造成一頂嘲諷的王冠，強行戴在了他的頭上。

\

His eyes met hers for just a moment, and she knew in a flash that He endured these atrocities deliberately and without regret -- for her, and for all humanity. 

他的目光與她相遇了片刻，她瞬間就知道，他故意忍受了這些暴行，沒有遺憾——為了她和全人類。

The crowd of Jews was silent for a moment as they took in the pitiable view of the man many had hoped might be the God-sent military Messiah who would free them from Rome's iron grasp.

當猶太人看到這個可憐的人時，他們沉默了一會兒，許多人希望這個人可能是上帝派來將他們從羅馬的鐵腕統治下解放出來的軍事彌賽亞。

\

Then, "Crucify! *Crucify!"* rang out from every quarter, with greater ferocity than before.

然後，｢釘在十字架上！ 釘在十字架上！」從每個季度都響起，比以前更兇猛。

\

After trying in vain to quiet the crowd, Pilate turned to Caiaphas.

在試圖讓人群安靜下來後，彼拉多轉向該亞法。

\

"Take Him yourselves and crucify Him, for I find no cause of execution in Him!" he said fiercely.

「你們自己把他帶走，把他釘在十字架上，因為我在他身上找不到處決的理由！」他兇狠地說。

\

Caiaphas stood and raised his hands, and the entire mob grew quickly silent.

該亞法站起來舉起了手，整個人群很快就沉默了。

\

He spoke distinctly, for all the mob to hear. "We have a law, and according to our law He must die, for He called Himself the *Son of God!"*

他說得很清楚，讓所有人都能聽到。 「我們有法律，根據我們的法律，他必須死，因為他稱自己為神的子！」

\

\
\

Son of *God?!*

神的子？！

\

Pilate turned on his heel and re-entered the judgement hall. 

彼拉多轉身，重新進入審判大廳。
