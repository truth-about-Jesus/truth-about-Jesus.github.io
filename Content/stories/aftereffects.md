It was clear that the young Galilean had breathed His last, so most of them left, as there was nothing more to see -- and they still had much to do before evening when the Sabbath would begin. 

很明顯，年輕的加利利人已經嚥了最後一口氣，所以他們中的大多數人都離開了，因為沒有什麼可看的了——在安息日開始的傍晚之前，他們還有很多事情要做。

\

Almost all of Jesus' chosen Apostles, fearful the bloodthirsty Jewish leaders might decide to execute *them* next, had retired, broken-hearted, to the upper room, where they had shared that last, precious Passover meal with their beloved Lord.

幾乎所有耶穌選擇的使徒，擔心嗜血的猶太領袖可能會決定下一步處決他們，他們心碎地退休到樓上，在那裡他們與他們心愛的主分享了最後一頓珍貴的逾越節餐。

Jesus' mother Mary, together with young John and Mary Magdalene, remained at the Cross at a distance, devastated and grieving.

耶穌的母親瑪利亞，以及年輕的約翰和抹大拉的瑪利亞，仍然在十字架附近，但距離很遠，充滿了悲傷。

Although the sight of Jesus' body hanging lifeless on the Cross pierced their hearts with unimaginable pain... 

儘管看到耶穌的屍體毫無生命地掛在十字架上，他們的心被難以想象的痛苦刺穿了......

Cornelius spoke curtly to the soldiers under his command.

科尼利厄斯對他麾下的士兵簡短地講話。

Having recovered from the darkness and earthquake himself, the centurion in charge of executions still retained -- even cherished -- that sense of awe from the events of the most unusual execution he had ever overseen -- or witnessed. 

在自己從黑暗和地震中恢復過來後，負責處決的百夫長仍然保留著——甚至珍惜——那種敬畏感——他曾經監督過的——或目睹過的最不尋常的處決事件。

\

But he still had a job to do.

但他還有工作要做。

\

Apparently, the Jews did not want the crucified men on display over the Sabbath. The Chief Priest himself had requested this favour to hasten death so the bodies could be taken down and buried before Passover, their most holy feast.

顯然，猶太人不希望被釘在十字架上的人在安息日被展示。 首席牧師本人曾請求這一個忙，以加速死亡，以便在逾越節（他們最神聖的節日）之前將屍體取下並埋葬。
