Soon after the terrifyingly bright, otherworldly being had disappeared, Flavius felt a slight lessening of the terror that had turned his intestines to jelly and flung him facedown on the ground.

隨著那令人恐懼的明亮、超凡脫俗的存在逐漸消退，弗拉維烏斯感到他的恐懼減輕了一些——正是這種恐懼奪走了他的勇氣，使他面朝下摔倒在地。

\

By the time the women had left, the burly Roman soldier was able to roll over and sit up. 

當婦女們離開時，這位身材魁梧的羅馬士兵能夠翻身並坐起來。

\

Suddenly remembering his guard duty, Flavius scrambled to check the cave where the "King of the Jews" had been interred.

弗拉維烏斯突然想起他的守衛職責，爭先恐後地去檢查埋葬「猶太人之王」的洞穴。

\

The corpse was gone. 

屍體不見了。

\

His heart dropped like a stone.

他的心像石頭一樣掉下來。

\

Returning, he found Decimus, his fellow guard, still in a facedown daze.

回來後，他發現他的警衛同伴德西默斯仍然面朝下，茫然無措。

\

"Get up!" He shook the younger man roughly. 

「起來！」 他粗暴地搖了搖那個年輕人。

\

"We've failed."

「我們失敗了。」

\
\

As the two Roman soldiers made their way into Jerusalem, Flavius sighed. 

當兩名羅馬士兵進入耶路撒冷時，弗拉維烏斯嘆了口氣。

\

He was an honourable man -- at least, he tried to be. 

他是一個可敬的人——至少，他努力成為。

\

But this situation -- *they could be sentenced to death for dereliction of duty!* -- called for something other than honour.

但這種情況──他們可能會因玩忽職守而被判死刑！ ——需要別的東西——而不是榮譽。

\

He only hoped the Jewish Chief Priest would be sufficiently intrigued by their report.

他只希望猶太祭司長能對他們的報告充分感興趣。

\
\

"We can't say *that!* The governor will *execute* us!!" Flavius protested, his face flushing red.

「我們不能這麼說！州長會處決我們的！！」弗拉維烏斯臉漲得通紅，抗議。

\

The Chief Priest studied the flustered Roman soldiers for a moment, the two sizeable bags of Tyrian shekels still jingling in his hands.

首席牧師研究了一會兒慌亂的羅馬士兵，兩袋相當大的提爾謝克爾仍然在他手中晃來晃去。

\

He sighed, then spoke reassuringly.

他嘆了一口氣，然後安慰道。

\

*"If* this report gets back to the governor, we will intervene on your behalf; you will not need to worry."

「如果這份報告還給州長，我們將代表你進行干預；你不必擔心。」

\

Flavius glanced at Decimus, then nodded numbly. They didn't have many options.

弗拉維烏斯看了一眼德西姆斯，然後麻木地點了點頭。他們沒有太多選擇。

\

"Now." Caiaphas looked at them dispassionately. 

「現在。」 該亞法冷靜地看著他們。

\

"What are you going to say?"

「你會告訴人們什麼？」

\

Dutifully, they repeated, their eyes fixed on the precious prize in the priest's hands: 

他們盡職盡責地重複了一遍，眼睛盯著牧師手中的寶貴獎品：

\

"His -- disciples came and -- *uh* -- stole the body, while we were -- *ah* --"

「他的——門徒來了——呃——偷了屍體，而我們——啊——」

\

They trailed off, then muttered: " -- sleeping."

他們說話聲音更小，然後喃喃自語道：「——睡覺。」

\

"Good."

「很好。」

\

The money was theirs.

這筆錢是他們的。
