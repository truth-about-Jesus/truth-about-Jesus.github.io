Jesus waited patiently as Herod looked Him over, declared Him *not* John the Baptist risen from the dead after all, requested a miraculous sign, peppered Him with questions, and paused to hear the false accusations the chief priests interjected every chance they got. 

耶穌耐心地等待著，希律審視著他，宣稱他畢竟不是從死裡復活的施洗者約翰，請求神蹟，向他提出了很多問題，並停下來聽大祭司一有機會插話的虛假指控。

\

He knew He was not to say a word. 

耶穌知道他不應該說一句話。

Finally, Herod, frustrated and annoyed by the silent, unresponsive prisoner, called for one of his own royal robes to be put on Jesus, as a mocking gesture.

最後，希律對沉默寡言、沒有反應的囚犯感到沮喪和惱火，他呼籲將自己的一件皇家長袍披在耶穌身上，作為嘲弄的姿態。

\

After belittling and insulting the silent Son of God together with his soldiers as much as he needed to restore his own sense of self-respect, he commanded the guard detail brusquely to take Jesus back to Pilate. 

在他和他的士兵貶低和侮辱了沉默的上帝之子，足以恢復他的自尊感之後，希律粗暴地命令衛兵把耶穌帶回彼拉多那裡。
