*"Peace be with you."*

「願你們平安。」

\

Everyone jumped. 

所有人都驚得跳了。

\

The upper room -- 

樓上的房間——

\

only a moment ago a hubbub of hope, doubt and speculation, Cleopas and Theudas sharing their newfound understanding of the prophetic writings --

就在片刻前，希望、懷疑和猜測的喧囂，克利奧帕斯和特烏達分享了他們對預言著作的新發現理解——

\

went utterly silent.

完全沉默了。

\

All stared apprehensively at the Man standing unexpectedly in their midst.

大家都擔心地看著這個突然和他們站在一起的男人。

\

*How* had He gotten in, through closed and locked doors?

他是如何從緊閉且上鎖的門進來的？

\

It *looked* like Jesus...

\

or was it --

還是它——

\

a *ghost?!*

鬼魂？！

\
\

"It's Me. Don't be afraid."

「是我。 不要害怕。」

\

In a heartbeat, the two Marys -- Jesus' mother and Magdalene -- came forward and knelt gladly at His feet.

很快，兩個瑪麗——耶穌的母親和抹大拉——走上前去，高興地跪在他的腳下。

\

The two disciples from Emmaus quickly followed.

來自以馬忤斯的兩個門徒迅速跟了上去。

\

All the others shifted uncomfortably, waiting to see what the apparition -- *which did look very much like Jesus!* -- would do.

其他人都不舒服地移動了，等著看幽靈——看起來非常像耶穌！——會做什麼。

"Why are you troubled? And why are your minds racing?"

「你們為什麼煩惱？ 為什麼你們的頭腦在飛速運轉？」

\

Jesus -- *or the ghost!* -- looked kindly at the terrified Apostles.

耶穌——或者鬼魂！——親切地看著驚恐的使徒們。

\

"Look at My hands and feet, and see: it's *Me!"*

「看看我的手和腳，看看：是我！」

\

No response... though the nail holes were evident.

沒有回應......雖然釘子孔很明顯。

\

*"Touch* Me and see." 

「摸摸我，看看。」

\

He held out His scarred hands. 

他伸出傷痕累累的手。

\

"A *ghost* doesn't have a physical body -- as *i* do."

「鬼魂沒有肉體——但倒我有。」

\

No one moved. Someone took a step back.

沒有人動。 有人退後了一步。

\

Jesus sighed.

耶穌嘆了口氣。

\

"You got any food?"

「你們有吃的嗎？」
