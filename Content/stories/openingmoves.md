Caiaphas waited impatiently as Pilate took his time settling himself on the judgement seat.

當彼拉多在審判席上安頓下來時，該亞法不耐煩地等待著。

\

At last, Pilate looked at him, and at the prisoner who had been thrust forward by the Temple guards. 

最後，彼拉多看著他，看著被聖殿守衛推上前的囚犯。

\

"What accusation do you bring against this man?"

“你對這個人提出了什麼指控？”

\

Caiaphas paused, knowing Jesus had done nothing at all against Roman law.

該亞法停頓了一下，知道耶穌沒有做任何違反羅馬律法的事情。

\

"If He were not an evildoer, we would not have brought Him to you," he finally hedged, hoping to move quickly on from this point to the threat of riot, when he would have the upper hand.

“如果他不是一個作惡者，我們就不會把他帶到你身邊，”他終於對沖了，希望從這一點迅速轉向騷亂的威脅，當他佔據上風時。

\

Pilate rolled his eyes. Not again. These Jews were always bringing prisoners to him who had done nothing wrong, as far as he could see -- except offending their religious sensibilities!

彼拉多翻了個白眼。 他們又這麼做了！ 這些猶太人總是把囚犯帶到他面前，在他看來，他們沒有做錯任何事——除了冒犯他們的宗教感情！

\

He stood.

他站著。

\

"This is obviously not a concern for Rome. Take Him away and judge Him according to your own law!" he growled, angry to have been rousted out of bed so early in the morning for such trivialities.

“這顯然與羅馬無關。 把他帶走，按照你自己的法律審判他！” 他煩躁地說，因為這些小事這麼早就被從床上爬起來，他很生氣。

\

Like a chess player, Caiaphas made his next move.

像棋手一樣，凱亞法斯邁出了下一步行動。

\

"We have no authority to put a man to death," he explained, knowing the mention of a death sentence would pique the governor's interest.

“我們沒有權力處死一個人，”他解釋說，因為他知道提到死刑會激起州長的興趣。

\

Death? thought Pilate with surprise. What could this man have done?

處死？ 彼拉多驚訝地想。 這個人做了什麼？

\

He gestured to his own soldiers, who took the prisoner from the Temple guards and brought him inside the judgement hall. 

他向自己的士兵做了個手勢，士兵從聖殿衛兵手中帶走了囚犯，並把他帶進了審判廳。

\

Pilate turned again to Caiaphas. 

彼拉多再次轉向該亞法。

\

"What is his name?"

他叫什麼名字？

\

"Jesus."

耶穌。

\

\
\

Jesus?

耶穌？

\

Pilate's mind whirled with possibilities as he followed the prisoner inside. 

\

Caiaphas had accused Him of claiming to be the king of the Jews. 

\

Yet his own centurion in Capernaum had not reported any such claim, which would, of course, be considered a potential threat to Rome's sovereignty in the region. 

\

He wondered.

\
\

"Are You the king of the Jews?" he asked Jesus bluntly, hoping to surprise Him into giving an honest response. 

\

Jesus looked at Pilate intently, already knowing what the response to His next words would be. 

\

"Is this from yourself, or did others say this about Me?"

\

"Am i a Jew?" retorted Pilate angrily. "Your own nation and chief priests have handed You over to me!"

\

"What did You do?" he pressed, thinking that this poor, bloody and bruised man did not appear to be enjoying any of the trappings of kingship. 

\

\
\

As if in response to Pilate's thought -- but there was no way He could have known! thought Pilate -- Jesus spoke clearly and decisively. 

\

"My kingdom is not of this world; if it were, My officers would have fought to stop the Jews from arresting Me; at this moment, My kingdom is not from here."

\

Pilate digested this surprising statement.

\

"So... You are a king, then?" Pilate questioned, wondering what Jesus meant by "at this moment"...

\

He knew he must gauge carefully any threat posed to Caesar's empire, regardless of any admiration his wife -- and even he himself, he admitted grudgingly -- held for this man.

\

\
\

"You have said that i am a king," Jesus responded enigmatically. 

\

He paused, then continued. 

\

"To this i was born, and for this i have come into the world: that i may testify to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears My Voice."

\

\
\

Ah! thought Pilate. He is a philosopher! That explains everything.

\

"What is truth?" he commented offhandedly, as he stood and prepared to go back outside to where the Jews waited impatiently for a verdict.
