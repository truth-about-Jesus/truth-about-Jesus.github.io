At last! All was ready.

終於！ 一切都準備好了。

\

Peter and John rested from their labours, enjoying the scintillating aroma of roast lamb as they surveyed the thirteen place settings at the table, the cups, the wine, the flat bread, and, of course, the roast lamb, along with the dipping sauce their host had so graciously provided.

彼得和約翰放下手中的工作，休息了一會兒，享受著烤羊肉的香氣。他們審視了餐桌上的十三個餐具，杯子、酒、麵包，當然還有烤羊肉，還有主人慷慨提供的蘸醬。

\

The blood of the lamb -- the sign that God would pass over their homes and spare their families when He had destroyed all the firstborn of their harsh Egyptian taskmasters -- had already been painted on the doorposts and lintel of the front door by the master of the house, who was graciously allowing Jesus and His twelve chosen Apostles to celebrate the Passover together in this upper room.

羔羊的血——這是一個跡象，表明上帝在消滅了嚴厲的埃及工頭的所有長子後，將越過他們的家園並饒恕他們的家人——已經被房子的主人畫在前門的門柱和門楣上，他慷慨地允許耶穌和他的十二位被選中的使徒在這個上層房間一起慶祝逾越節。

\

Now all that remained was for Jesus and the other ten to arrive and celebrate Passover together, as God had ordained so many years ago through Moses, the night He'd freed their people from four hundred years of slavery. 

現在，他們只需要等待耶穌和其他十使徒到來，就可以一起慶祝逾越節了，正如上帝多年前透過摩西所吩咐的那樣，那天晚上他把他們的人民從四百年的奴隸制中解放出來。

\

Peter looked at John, who looked away. All of the disciples were avoiding each other's eyes as the realization came: the master of the house had neglected to provide any servant to wash their dusty, dirty feet!

彼得看著約翰，約翰把目光移開。 當人們意識到時，所有的門徒都在躲避對方的眼睛：房子的主人忽略了提供任何僕人來洗他們塵土飛揚的髒腳！

\

They were all at table, almost ready to begin. Jesus, with John beside Him -- as the youngest, John was always right next to Jesus -- Matthew, Bartholomew, Thomas, Judas Iscariot, Peter, James, Andrew, Thaddeus, Simon, Philip and the other James, the son of Alphaeus.

他們都坐到了餐桌旁，幾乎準備開始了。耶穌，約翰在他身邊──身為最年輕的使徒，約翰總是在耶穌旁邊──馬太、巴多羅買、多馬、加略人猶大、彼得、雅各、安得烈、達太、西門、腓力和亞勒腓的兒子雅各。

\

They had grown accustomed to the VIP treatment meted out to them as Jesus' celebrity had increased exponentially. 

隨著耶穌的名人呈指數級增長，他們已經習慣了對他們的貴賓待遇。

\

Now, all were in a quandary. 

現在，所有的使徒都不知道該怎麼辦了。

\

_If I do it, I'll be lowering myself,_ thought Peter, looking meaningfully at John, whom he liked to consider his deputy. 

如果我這樣做，我會降低自己，彼得想，有意義地看著約翰，他喜歡把他當作他的副手。

\

John avoided Peter's eyes. _He isn't going to rope me into doing the servant's job! Not this time!_ he thought, steeling himself to withstand Peter's naturally overbearing personality. 

約翰避開了彼得的眼睛。 他不會騙我去做僕人的工作！這次不行！ 他想，為了抵擋彼得天生的霸道性格而強行。

\

The other disciples looked at each other uncomfortably. Judas Iscariot had already made up his mind not to involve himself in the petty quarrels in which the others sometimes engaged. He had higher matters to consider -- like determining exactly when would be the best time to hand Jesus over to the Chief Priests... and truly earn that bag of Tyrian shekels that were burning a hole in his pocket. 

其他門徒不舒服地看著對方。 加略人猶大已經下定決心不捲入其他人有時捲入的小爭吵中。 他有更高的考慮事項要考慮——比如確切地確定何時是將耶穌交給祭司長的最佳時機......並真正賺取那袋在他的口袋裡燒了一個洞的提謝克爾。


\

After enduring several moments of silent jockeying for position among His chosen Apostles, Jesus sighed.

在忍受了幾次默默地爭奪他選擇的使徒中的位置後，耶穌嘆了口氣。 

\

He'd known in advance what He was going to do. His Father had made it clear. But the obvious rivalry between His closest friends and followers told Him they all still had a long way to go.

他事先知道他要做什麼。 他的父親已經說清楚了。 但他最親密的朋友和追隨者之間的明顯競爭告訴他，他們還有很長的路要走。 

\

He stood up. 

他站起來了。

\

All eyes turned to Him rather guiltily, as if expecting Him to now clarify which of them was the low man on the apostolic totem pole. Every man breathed a silent prayer in his heart that Jesus would not ask him to "do the honours"...

所有的目光都相當內疚地轉向他，彷彿期待他現在澄清他們中誰是使徒圖騰柱上的低等人。每個人都在心裡默默地祈禱，祈求耶穌不要要求他「做僕人」…

\
\

When Jesus got to Peter, Peter roused himself from his dumbfounded reverie. 

當耶穌來到彼得身邊時，彼得從他目瞪口呆的遐想中振作起來。

\

"Lord? Are <u>You</u> going to wash <u>my</u> feet?!"

「主啊？你要給我洗腳嗎？！」

\

They had all been stunned... and silent... but Peter's question awoke them from their own bewildered trances. 

他們都驚呆了......沉默了......但彼得的問題把他們從自己困惑的恍惚中喚醒。

\

Jesus had taken off His big cloak, tied a towel around His waist, taken a large basin of clean water, and proceeded to "do the honours" Himself, as if He were nothing more than a common household slave!

耶穌脫下他的大斗篷，把毛巾綁在腰上，拿了一大盆乾淨的水，然後自己「做僕人」，好像他只不過是一個普通的家庭奴隸！

\

Going around to each of the Apostles in turn, He knelt down, placed their feet in the water-filled basin, and washed off all the dirt, dust and grime with His own hands. He then towelled the clean feet dry using the towel around His waist. 

他依次走到每個使徒身邊，跪下，把他們的腳放在裝滿水的盆子裡，用自己的雙手洗掉所有的汙垢、灰塵和汙垢。 然後他用腰間的毛巾擦乾他們乾淨的腳。

\

As usual, Peter had been the first to find his words. 

像往常一樣，彼得是第一個找到他的話的人。

\

\
\

"You do not know what I am doing now," responded Jesus gently, "but afterwards, you will know."

「你不知道我現在在做什麼，」 耶穌溫和地回答， 「但之後，你會知道的。」

\

Indignation rose in Peter at His beloved Lord and Master's total humiliation in taking on a servant's role. It was unthinkable!

彼得對他心愛的主和主人在扮演僕人的角色時完全羞辱而感到憤慨。 這是不可想象的！

\

"<u>No</u>!" He spoke decisively and more loudly than he had intended. He didn't understand why, but something about Jesus' willingness to lower Himself in this way frightened him. It seemed unnatural...

「不！」 他說話果斷，聲音比他預期的要大。 他不明白為什麼，但耶穌願意以這種方式降低自己，這讓他感到害怕。 這似乎不自然......

\

He pulled his feet away. 

他把腳拉開了。

\

"You shall <u>never</u> wash my feet!"

「你永遠不會洗我的腳！」

\

Jesus looked at Peter kindly. He had expected some pushback from His most outspoken, impulsive follower. And He knew something else about Peter that saddened Him immeasurably...

耶穌親切地看著彼得。 他本以為他最直言不諱、衝動的追隨者會有所反擊。 他知道關於彼得的其他事情，這讓他感到難以估量的悲傷......

\

"If I do not wash you, you have no part with Me," He explained gently.

「如果我不洗你，你就不會和我在一起，」 他溫柔地解釋道。

\

Peter was shocked at this statement. _No part with Jesus?!_

彼得對這句話感到震驚。他不會和耶穌在一起嗎？

\

Now <u>that</u> was <u>truly</u> unthinkable.

現在這確實是不可想象的。

\

With all his resistance melted away, Peter spoke urgently.

隨著他所有的抵抗都消失了，彼得緊急地說話了。

\

"Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head!"

「主啊，不要只洗我的腳，還要洗我的手和頭！」

\

Jesus smiled as He proceeded to wash just Peter's feet. "The one who has been bathed only needs to wash his feet, and he is completely clean," He explained.

耶穌微笑著只洗彼得的腳。 他解釋說，「洗過澡的人只需要洗腳，而且他完全乾淨。」

\

"And all of you are clean --" He added, then paused. _"Yet not all."_

「你們都乾淨了——」他補充道，然後停了下來。 「但不是你們所有人。」

\
\

Judas Iscariot was troubled by that last statement, spoken in his direction, he thought... or had he imagined it?

加略人猶大對最後那句話感到不安，他想，這句話是針對他說的……還是他想像出來的？

\

He had looked down for a moment while feeling once again for the bag of Tyrian shekels in his pocket -- just to make sure they were there -- when Jesus had made that last, rather pointed statement. 

當耶穌做出最後一個相當尖銳的宣告時，他低頭看了一會兒，再次感覺到口袋裡的一袋提爾謝克爾——只是為了確保它們在那裡——所以他不確定耶穌在說誰。

\

_Of course,_ betraying Jesus bothered him! What man alive could betray this young, innocent, powerful, amazingly good man and not feel some measure of regret?

當然，背叛耶穌困擾著他！ 活著的人能背叛這個年輕、無辜、有權勢、令人驚訝的好人，而不會感到某種程度的遺憾？

\

_But Jesus shouldn't have wasted all that money!_ he reminded himself rather fiercely. 

但耶穌不應該浪費那麼多錢！ 他非常強烈地提醒自己。

\

And it would turn out alright. 

一切都會好起來的。

\

What the chief priests didn't know was Jesus' talent for escaping those who wanted to kill Him. 

祭司長們不知道的是耶穌逃脫那些想殺死他的人的天賦。

\

Time and again, when people had tried to seize Him, Jesus had simply, easily walked away. 

一次又一次，當人們試圖抓住他時，耶穌只是輕而易舉地走了。

\

Once, in His hometown of Nazareth, he had enraged the entire community to the point where they had forced Him to the top of the cliff on which the town was built and tried to throw Him off. 

有一次，在他的家鄉拿撒勒，他激怒了整個社區，他們將他強行推到城鎮所在的懸崖頂上，並試圖將他從懸崖上扔下去。

\

Jesus had walked away from that, too. 

耶穌也離開了那個。

\

Unscathed. 

毫無損。

\

And He never took revenge on His attackers, either. 

他也從未向攻擊者報仇。

\

Judas knew it would turn out alright. Jesus would escape no matter what Judas did. 

猶大知道事情會好起來的。 無論猶大做什麼，耶穌會逃脫。

\

And then he would have truly earned his precious reward!

然後他真的賺到了寶貴的回報！
