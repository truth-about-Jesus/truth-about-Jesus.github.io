At last! All was ready.

終於！ 一切都準備好了。

\

Peter and John rested from their labours, enjoying the scintillating aroma of roast lamb as they surveyed the thirteen place settings at the table, the cups, the wine, the flat bread, and, of course, the roast lamb, along with the dipping sauce their host had so graciously provided.

\

The blood of the lamb -- the sign that God would pass over their homes and spare their families when He had destroyed all the firstborn of their harsh Egyptian taskmasters -- had already been painted on the doorposts and lintel of the front door by the master of the house, who was graciously allowing Jesus and His twelve chosen Apostles to celebrate the Passover together in this upper room.

\

Now all that remained was for Jesus and the other ten to arrive and celebrate Passover together, as God had ordained so many years ago through Moses, the night He'd freed their people from four hundred years of slavery. 

\

\

Peter looked at John, who looked away. All of the disciples were avoiding each other's eyes as the realization came: the master of the house had neglected to provide any servant to wash their dusty, dirty feet!

\

They were all at table, almost ready to begin. Jesus, with John beside Him -- as the youngest, John was always right next to Jesus -- Matthew, Bartholomew, Thomas, Judas Iscariot, Peter, James, Andrew, Thaddeus, Simon, Philip, Nathaniel and the other James, son of Alphaeus.

\

They had grown accustomed to the VIP treatment meted out to them as Jesus' celebrity had increased exponentially. 

\

Now, all were in a quandary. 

\

If I do it, I'll be lowering myself, thought Peter, looking meaningfully at John, whom he liked to consider his deputy. 

\

John avoided Peter's eyes. He isn't going to rope me into doing the servant's job! Not this time! he thought, steeling himself to withstand Peter's naturally overbearing personality. 

\

The other disciples looked at each other uncomfortably. Judas Iscariot had already made up his mind not to involve himself in the petty quarrels in which the others sometimes engaged. He had higher matters to consider -- like determining exactly when would be the best time to hand Jesus over to the Chief Priests... and truly earn that bag of Tyrian shekels that were burning a hole in his pocket. 

\

After enduring several moments of silent jockeying for position among His chosen Apostles, Jesus sighed. 

\

He'd known in advance what He was going to do. His Father had made it clear. But the obvious rivalry between His closest friends and followers told Him they all still had a long way to go. 

\

He stood up. 

\

All eyes turned to Him rather guiltily, as if expecting Him to now clarify which of them was the low man on the apostolic totem pole. Every man breathed a silent prayer in his heart that Jesus would not ask him to "do the honours"...

\

💠

\

When Jesus got to Peter, Peter roused himself from his dumbfounded reverie. 

\

"Lord? Are You going to wash my feet?!"

\

They had all been stunned... and silent... but Peter's question awoke them from their own bewildered trances. 

\

Jesus had taken off His big cloak, tied a towel around His waist, taken a large basin of clean water, and proceeded to "do the honours" Himself, as if He were nothing more than a common household slave!

\

Going around to each of the Apostles in turn, He knelt down, placed their feet in the water-filled basin, and washed off all the dirt, dust and grime with His own hands. He then towelled the clean feet dry using the towel around His waist. 

\

As usual, Peter had been the first to find his words. 

\

💠

\

"You do not know what I am doing now," responded Jesus gently, "but afterwards, you will know."

\

Indignation rose in Peter at His beloved Lord and Master's total humiliation in taking on a servant's role. It was unthinkable!

\

"No!" He spoke decisively and more loudly than he had intended. He didn't understand why, but something about Jesus' willingness to lower Himself in this way frightened him. It seemed unnatural...

\

He pulled his feet away. 

\

"You shall never wash my feet!"

\

Jesus looked at Peter kindly. He had expected some pushback from His most outspoken, impulsive follower. And He knew something else about Peter that saddened Him immeasurably...

\

"If I do not wash you, you have no part with Me," He explained gently.

\

Peter was shocked at this statement. No part with Jesus?!

\

Now that was truly unthinkable.

\

With all his resistance melted away, Peter spoke urgently.

\

"Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head!"

\

Jesus smiled as He proceeded to wash just Peter's feet. "The one who has been bathed only needs to wash his feet, and he is completely clean," He explained.

\

"And all of you are clean --" He added, then paused. "Yet not all."

\

💠

\

Judas Iscariot was troubled by that last statement, spoken in his direction, he thought... or had he imagined it?

\

He had looked down for a moment while feeling once again for the bag of Tyrian shekels in his pocket -- just to make sure they were there -- when Jesus had made that last, rather pointed statement. 

\

Of course betraying Jesus bothered him! What man alive could betray this young, innocent, powerful, amazingly good man and not feel some measure of regret?

\

But Jesus shouldn't have wasted all that money! he reminded himself rather fiercely. 

\

And it would turn out alright. 

\

What the chief priests didn't know was Jesus' talent for escaping those who wanted to kill Him. 

\

Time and again, when people had tried to seize Him, Jesus had simply, easily walked away. 

\

Once, in His hometown of Nazareth, he had enraged the entire community to the point where they had forced Him to the top of the cliff on which the town was built and tried to throw Him off. 

\

Jesus had walked away from that, too. 

\

Unscathed. 

\

And He never took revenge on His attackers, either. 

\

Judas knew it would turn out alright. Jesus would escape no matter what Judas did. 

\

And then he would have truly earned his precious reward!
