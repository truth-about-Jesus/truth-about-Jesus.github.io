Isaac was playing with Hoppy when the big men came in through the door of the house, led by Daddy, who quickly went back out to see about some dinner. 

當以撒和料斗玩耍時，許多身材高大的男人被以撒的父親領進了家，他趕緊出去為他們準備晚餐。

\

The toddler felt a little shy and drew back toward the corner, but one of the men approached, squatted down, and looked at him with a gentle smile. 

蹣跚學步的孩子感到有點害羞，往角落裡退了一步，但其中一個男人走了過來，蹲下來，溫柔地微笑著看著他。

\

“Hello, little fella. May we come rest in your house for a bit?”

「你好，小傢伙。我們可以去你家休息一下嗎？」

\

Isaac looked at him with big eyes and nodded solemnly. He forgot to hold onto Hoppy, so the little frog wriggled out of his hands and disappeared into the shadows. 

以撒睜大眼睛看著他，鄭重地點點頭。 他忘了抓住料斗，小青蛙從他手中掙脫出來，消失在陰影中。

\

The friendly man turned back to the others -- there were so many Isaac could not count them all! -- and asked, “What was it you were all discussing on the road?”

友善的人轉身面對其他人——人數多到以撒數不清了！ ——然後問道：「你們在路上聊了什麼？」

\

The other men seemed suddenly shy themselves, and didn't answer, but looked down, or away. 

其他人似乎突然害羞了，沒有回答，而是低下頭，或看向別處。

\

Isaac stared at them curiously, waiting for someone to say something. It was awfully quiet now!

以撒好奇地看著他們，等待有人說話。 現在很安靜！

\

\
\

The nice man sat down, and called the others to sit as well, so they all slowly sat down.

好心人坐了下來，又叫其他人也坐下，於是他們都慢慢地坐下了。

\

Isaac sat down, too, but then the nice man turned to him. 

以撒也坐下來，但隨後這個好人轉向他。

\

“Little fella, how about you come here in the middle?”

「小傢伙，你中間過來怎麼樣？」

\

Isaac got up and stepped forward shyly. The nice man picked him up and placed him gently in his lap, then turned to the others, speaking quietly.

以撒站起來，害羞地向前走去。 好心的男人把他抱起來，輕輕放在腿上，然後轉向其他人，輕聲說。

\

“Whoever wants to be first will be last of all, and servant of all.”

「誰想成為第一，誰就會成為最後一個，成為所有人的僕人。」

\

The other men frowned. Isaac thought at first that maybe they didn't like what the nice man had said.

其他男人都皺起了眉頭。 以撒一開始以為他們可能不喜歡這個好人所說的話。

\

But one by one, most of their faces began to soften as the nice man continued.

但隨著好人繼續說下去，大部分人的臉色都開始變得柔和起來，一張一張。

\

“This is the truth: unless you change, and become like a little child, you do not enter the Kingdom of Heaven.”

「這是事實：除非你改變，變得像個小孩子，否則你不會進入天國。」

\

Isaac liked that. He didn't know what the Kingdom of Heaven was, but if there were kids there, he guessed it would be a fun place.

以撒喜歡這樣。 他不知道天國是什麼，但如果那裡有小孩子的話，他猜想那一定是個好玩的地方。

\

\
\

“Whoever humbles himself like this little child will be great in the Kingdom of Heaven.”

「誰像這個小孩子一樣謙卑自己，誰就會在天國裡成為偉大的人。」

\

The big men were staring at Isaac, frowning again. A little abashed, he buried his face in the rough folds of the nice man's clothing, feeling almost safer than he did with Mommy. 

大漢們盯著以撒，再次皺了皺眉頭。 他感到害羞，把臉埋在好人衣服粗糙的褶皺裡。 他感覺幾乎比和母親在一起更安全。

\

\
\

“Whoever receives one child like this in My Name, receives Me.”

「凡以我的名接待這樣一個孩子的人，就是接待了我。」

\

“And whoever causes one of these little ones believing in Me to stumble, it would be better for him to have a heavy millstone hung around his neck, and be submerged in the depths of the sea.”

「無論誰讓這些相信我的小孩子跌倒，對他來說，最好在他的脖子上掛上一塊沉重的磨石，並浸入海底深處。」

\

This made Isaac shiver a little and snuggle in deeper.

這讓以撒有點顫抖，依偎得更深。

\

“Woe to the world because of stumbling blocks! They have to come, but woe to that person through whom they come.”

「世界的絆腳石有禍了！他們必須來，但帶來他們的人有禍了。」

\

When Isaac finally resurfaced, most of the men were smiling at him with kindly eyes.

當以撒終於重新出現時，大多數人都用友善的目光對他微笑。

\
\

Looking at this gentle child made it all make sense, thought John shamefacedly.

看著這個溫柔的孩子，一切都說得通了，約翰羞愧地想。

\

The pride that had expanded his chest as he had argued eloquently for Peter's supremacy among the disciples -- and himself as Peter's lieutenant -- didn't feel so amazing anymore. 

以前，當他雄辯地論證彼得在門徒中的至高無上時，以及他自己作為彼得的副手時，他感到自豪。 但現在，那種驕傲感已經不再那麼令人驚奇了。

\

“We were arguing about which of us was greater, Jesus,” he admitted quietly. He looked down. 

「我們正在爭論誰更偉大，耶穌，」他平靜地承認。 他低下頭。

\

Jesus caught his eye and smiled, and John immediately felt better. 

耶穌看著他微笑，約翰立刻感覺好多了。

\
\

The other disciples began to chime in slowly.

其他弟子也開始慢慢附和。

\

“Yeah.”

「是的。」

\

“We didn't know, Lord.”

「我們不知道，主。」

\
\

One of the men caught Hoppy and picked him up gently. He brought the little frog back to Isaac, squatting down to offer him to the boy at his level.

其中一名男子抓住料斗，輕輕把他抱了起來。 他把小青蛙抱回以撒身邊，跪下，將他交給男孩。

\

“Here ya go, little guy!”

「來了，小傢伙！」

\

As Isaac accepted his beloved pet gratefully, the man tousled Isaac's hair and gave him a cheerful grin. 

當以撒感激地接受了他心愛的寵物時，那個男人撥亂了以撒的頭髮，給了他一個愉快的笑容。

\

A wide smile lit up Isaac's face. The atmosphere had changed, and he found himself suddenly quite at ease with the kindly, laughing guests. 

以撒的臉上綻放出燦爛的笑容。 氣氛變了，他發現自己突然對那些和善、歡笑的客人感到很自在。
