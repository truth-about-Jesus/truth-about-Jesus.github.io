Pilate watched carefully as Jesus was stripped of His clothes and bound by the wrists to the low post specially designed for scourging. 

彼拉多仔細地看著耶穌被脫掉衣服，手腕綁在專門為鞭打而設計的低柱上。

\

As the two lictors took up their positions, one on either side of the prostrate prisoner, Pilate stepped forward and lifted a warning hand.

兩名拿著鞭子的士兵就位，一個在跪著的囚犯的一側，另一個在另一側。然後彼拉多上前舉手警告。

\

*"Don't --"*

「別一一｣

\

he spoke severely,

他說話嚴厲，

\

"kill Him."

「一一殺他。｣

\

Then he turned on his heel and walked away. 

然後他轉身走了。

\

The first lictor raised his *scorpio,* a multi-thonged leather whip embedded with shards of bone and metal.

第一個士兵舉起了他的羅馬鞭子，鞭子上有許多帶子，上面嵌著鋒利的骨頭和金屬碎片。

\

Jesus tried to brace Himself for the first blow, but He knew it wasn't truly possible, and He knew His Father, Who could do the impossible, was not going to soften any of it.

耶穌試圖為第一次打擊做好準備，但他知道這是不可能的。他知道他的天父能夠完成不可能的事，但這次他不會幫助耶穌。

\

For the next little while, He could not think or speak or even control His bodily functions.

在接下來的一段時間裡，他無法思考、說話，甚至無法控制自己的身體機能。

\

All He could do was cry out in agony.

他能做的就是痛苦地哭出來。

\

\
\

After a while, He could not even do that. 

過了一會兒，他甚至做不到那件事。

\

\
\

"He's still alive, your Lordship... barely."

「他還活著，大人……只是一點點而已。」

\

The lictor appeared in the doorway. He didn't enter, as he was still covered with bits of skin, blood, muscle and bone from his latest victim, the prisoner brought in by the Jews. He needed to wash.

拿著鞭子的羅馬士兵出現在門口。他沒有進去，因為他身上仍然沾滿了最新受害者（猶太人帶來的囚犯）的皮膚、血液、肌肉和骨頭。他需要洗漱。

\

Pilate nodded curtly.

彼拉多簡短地點點頭。

\

Sophia might never forgive him.

索菲亞可能永遠不會原諒他。
