"O unthinking, and slow in heart to believe everything the prophets have said!" 

「噢，那些不思考的人，他們的心裡遲緩意相信先知所說的話！」

\

Cleopas flinched a little at this unexpected rebuke.

克利奧帕斯對於這意想不到的斥責感到吃驚，並且有點受傷。

\

"Didn't the Messiah *have* to suffer these things," continued the stranger, "to enter into His glory?"

陌生人繼續說：「難道彌賽亞不必遭受這些苦難，才能獲得他的榮耀嗎？」

\

Astonished, the two disciples stared at one another. 

兩個弟子驚訝地互相凝視著。

\

Who *was* this man?

It was getting late when Cleopas looked up and saw they were approaching their home village of Emmaus.

天色已晚，克利奧帕斯抬頭一看，發現他們正接近家鄉艾瑪烏斯村。

\

So amazing, encouraging and enlightening had been the stranger's discourse on the prophecies concerning the Messiah...

陌生人關於彌賽亞預言的論述是如此令人驚奇、鼓舞和有啟發性......

\

Cleopas didn't want the conversation to end.

克利奧帕斯不想結束談話。

\

When he and Theudas slowed to turn in at the path leading home, the stranger kept walking.

當他和特烏達斯放慢腳步，拐進回家的小路時，陌生人仍繼續前進。

\

"Stay with us," Cleopas called to him hopefully. "It's late."

「和我們呆在一起，」克利奧帕斯充滿希望地叫他。 「很晚了。」
