Peter watched Judas Iscariot hurry out the door, thinking perhaps Jesus had sent him on an errand to buy something, or maybe give a gift to the poor.

彼得看著加略人猶大匆匆走出門，以為也許耶穌派他去跑腿去買東西，或者給窮人送禮物。

\

Jesus seemed somehow relieved and more relaxed, yet still sorrowful.

耶穌似乎在某種程度上鬆了一口氣，更放鬆了，但仍然很悲傷。

\

"Now the Son of Man is glorified, and God is glorified in Him. And if God is glorified in Him, God will glorify Him in Himself, and will glorify Him immediately."

「人子得榮耀了，神也在他身上得榮耀了。 如果上帝在他身上榮耀，上帝會在他自己身上榮耀他，並立即榮耀他。」

\

There was general puzzlement among the Apostles. What was Jesus saying?

使徒們普遍感到困惑。 耶穌在說什麼？

\

Being glorified sounded like a good thing, reasoned John. So why did Jesus seem so sad?

約翰推理道，被榮耀聽起來是件好事。 那麼，為什麼耶穌看起來如此悲傷？

\

And what about Judas Iscariot? He had escaped!

加略人猶大呢？ 他逃脫了！

\

Something had to be done. So why was Jesus doing nothing? He had actually encouraged Judas to leave without alerting the others!

必須做一些事情。 那麼，為什麼耶穌什麼都不做？ 他實際上鼓勵猶大在不提醒其他人的情況下離開！

\

John thought a bit more about this.

約翰對此想得更多一點。

\

Perhaps Jesus would escape from the Chief Priests as He had escaped from others so many times before.

也許耶穌會逃離祭司長，就像他以前多次逃離其他人一樣。

\

But lately He had spoken much of... of things happening that were completely unthinkable. _He_ is the Messiah! Terrible things _cannot_ happen to Him! God gives His Anointed One _victory_ over His enemies!

但最近他談到了很多……發生的事情，這些事情是完全不可想像的。他是彌賽亞！不會有什麼可怕的事發生在他身上！神讓祂的受膏者戰勝了祂的敵人！

"My children, i am with you for just a little longer; and you will look for Me; and now i say to you what i said to the Jews earlier: where i am going you cannot come."

「我的孩子們，我和你們在一起還有一會兒；你們會尋找我；現在我對你們說我以前對猶太人說過的話：我要去的地方，你們不能去。」

\

_What?!_ Peter couldn't believe it.

什麼？！ 彼得不敢相信。

\

He had given up _everything_ to follow Jesus -- home, family, livelihood -- and now Jesus was _abandoning_ them?!

他為了跟隨耶穌而放棄了一切——家、家庭、生計——現在耶穌拋棄了他們？！

\

What did Jesus expect him to do? Go back to _fishing?!_

耶穌期望他做什麼？ 回去釣魚？！

\

He could never -- not after all he'd been through with Jesus!

他永遠不可能——畢竟他和耶穌一起經歷了！

\

He would _never_ let Jesus go. 

他永遠不會讓耶穌走。

\

_Ever._

永遠。

\

John was beginning to have an inkling that Jesus was walking knowingly and deliberately into a fate greater than Himself -- or the twelve of them.

約翰開始意識到耶穌正在有意識地、有意地走向比祂自己（或他們十二個人）更偉大的命運。

\

So he was still able to focus as Jesus continued.

因此，當耶穌繼續時，他仍然能夠集中注意力。

\

"A new command i give you: love one another as i have loved you. Everyone will know that you are My followers if you love one another."

「我給你一個新的命令：彼此相愛，就像我愛你一樣。 如果你們彼此相愛，每個人都會知道你們是我的追隨者。」

\

Now Peter broke in. He had not heard anything after Jesus had said He was going away, and he could not listen anymore.

現在彼得打斷了。耶穌說要離開後，他什麼也沒聽到，他再也聽不下去了。

\

His heart was being torn in two. He had to speak, to end this freakish nightmare.

他的心被撕成兩分。 他必須說話，才能結束這場怪異的噩夢。

\

"Lord? Where are You going?"

「主啊？ 你要去哪裡？」

\

Jesus looked at him with measureless compassion, knowing that Peter would soon experience even more terrible heartbreak.

耶穌帶著無比的憐憫看著他，知道彼得很快就會經歷更可怕的心碎。

\

So He spoke with infinite tenderness.

所以他以無限的溫柔說話。

\

"Where i am going, you cannot follow right now, but you will follow in the end."

「我要去的地方，你現在不能跟隨，但你最終會跟隨。」

\

This was not acceptable to Peter. He was not willing, after all they'd been through together, to let go of his Lord and Master so easily.

這對彼得來說是不可接受的。 畢竟他們一起經歷了這一切，他不願意如此輕易地放開他的主和主人。

\

"My Lord, why can't i follow You now? i am ready to lay down my life for You!"

「主啊，為什麼我現在不能跟隨您？我已經準備好為您而死了！」

\

"Are you ready to lay down your life for Me?" Jesus paused, knowing full well how His next words would be received by this impetuous firebrand of an Apostle through whom He fully intended to build something beautiful and magnificent.

「你準備好為我去死了嗎？」 耶穌停頓了一下，他很清楚這位像火把一樣的使徒會如何接受他接下來的話。他完全打算透過他建造一些美麗而巨集偉的東西。

\

"I'm telling you the truth: Tonight, before the rooster crows twice, you will say that you don't know Me -- _three times!"_

“我跟你說實話：今晚，在公雞叫兩次之前，你會說你不認識我——三次！”

\

Anger and determination rose in Peter's chest. 

憤怒和決心在彼得的胸膛中升起。

\

Jesus may be a prophet -- yes, even the Son of God! -- but Peter had _always_ conquered through force of will, and tonight would be no different!

耶穌是一位先知——是的，甚至是上帝的兒子！——但彼得總是透過意志的力量征服，今晚也不例外！

\

"Even if i have to die with You, i will _never_ deny knowing You, my Lord!" he contended fiercely.

「即使我必須和你一起死，我永遠不會否認認識你，我的主！」 他激烈地爭辯。

\

All the other Apostles said the same.

所有其他使徒都說了同樣的話。

\

Peter thought quickly. John's whispered revelation as they had followed Jesus out the door and into the night had floored him -- Judas had seemed like such a decent guy... Peter had genuinely liked him...!

彼得想得很快。 約翰的低聲啟示，當他們跟隨耶穌走出門，進入黑夜時，這讓他感到震驚——猶大看起來像一個體面的人...... 彼得真的很喜歡他......！

\

Now, he steeled himself to do what must be done. Judas Iscariot must not be permitted to hand Jesus over to the religious leaders.

現在，他堅定地去做必須做的事情。 不得允許加略人猶大將耶穌交給宗教領袖。

\

Of late, Jesus had seemed more morose and negative, saying things that seemed to Peter defeatist and unacceptable.

最近，耶穌似乎更加悶悶不平，說了一些在彼得看來是失敗主義和不可接受的事情。

\

He felt under his cloak for his sword. As a fisherman, he had never had cause to use such a thing. But now, if Jesus was right about Judas --

他在斗篷下摸了摸他的劍。 作為一名漁夫，他從來沒有理由使用過這樣的東西。 但現在，如果耶穌對猶大的看法是對的——

\

he, Peter, was going to have to do it.

他，彼得，將不得不這樣做。

\

He would _prove_ -- beyond the shadow of a doubt -- his total devotion to Jesus!

他將證明他對耶穌的完全忠誠，這樣就沒有人可以再懷疑他了。
