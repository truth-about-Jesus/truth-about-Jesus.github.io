7 - Peter's devotion
---
Peter watched Judas Iscariot hurry out the door, thinking perhaps Jesus had sent him on an errand to buy something, or maybe give a gift to the poor.

\

Jesus seemed somehow relieved and more relaxed, yet still sorrowful.

\

"Now the Son of Man is glorified, and God is glorified in Him. And if God is glorified in Him, God will glorify Him in Himself, and will glorify Him immediately."

\

There was general puzzlement among the Apostles. What was Jesus saying?

\

Being glorified sounded like a good thing, reasoned John. So why did Jesus seem so sad?

\

And what about Judas Iscariot? He had escaped!

\

Something had to be done. So why was Jesus doing nothing? He had actually encouraged Judas to leave without alerting the others!

\

John thought a bit more about this.

\

Perhaps Jesus would escape from the Chief Priests as He had escaped from others so many times before.

\

But lately He had spoken much of... of things happening that were completely unthinkable. _He_ is the Messiah! Terrible things _cannot_ happen to Him! God gives His Anointed One _victory_ over His enemies!

"My children, i am with you for just a little longer; and you will look for Me; and now i say to you what i said to the Jews earlier: where i am going you cannot come."

\

_What?!_ Peter couldn't believe it.

\

He had given up _everything_ to follow Jesus -- home, family, livelihood -- and now Jesus was _abandoning_ them?!

\

What did Jesus expect him to do? Go back to _fishing?!_

\

He could never -- not after all he'd been through with Jesus!

\

He would _never_ let Jesus go. 

\

_Ever._

\

John was beginning to have an inkling that Jesus was walking knowingly and deliberately into a fate greater than Himself -- or the twelve of them.

\

So he was still able to focus as Jesus continued.

\

"A new command i give you: love one another as i have loved you. Everyone will know that you are My followers if you love one another."

\

Now Peter broke in. He had not heard anything after Jesus had said He was going away, and he could not listen anymore.

\

His heart was being torn in two. He had to speak, to end this freakish nightmare.

\

"Lord? Where are You going?"

\

Jesus looked at him with measureless compassion, knowing that Peter would soon experience even more terrible heartbreak.

\

So He spoke with infinite tenderness.

\

"Where i am going, you cannot follow right now, but you will follow in the end."

\

This was not acceptable to Peter. He was not willing, after all they'd been through together, to let go of his Lord and Master so easily.

\

"My Lord, why can't i follow You now? i am ready to lay down my life for You!"

\

"Are you ready to lay down your life for Me?" Jesus paused, knowing full well how His next words would be received by this impetuous firebrand of an Apostle through whom He fully intended to build something beautiful and magnificent.

\

"I'm telling you the truth: Tonight, before the rooster crows twice, you will say that you don't know Me -- _three times!"_

\

\
\

Anger and determination rose in Peter's chest. 

\

Jesus may be a prophet -- yes, even the Son of God! -- but Peter had _always_ conquered through force of will, and tonight would be no different!

\

"Even if i have to die with You, i will _never_ deny knowing You, my Lord!" he contended fiercely.

\

All the other Apostles said the same.

\
\

Peter thought quickly. John's whispered revelation as they had followed Jesus out the door and into the night had floored him -- Judas had seemed like such a decent guy... Peter had genuinely liked him...!

\

Now, he steeled himself to do what must be done. Judas Iscariot must not be permitted to hand Jesus over to the religious leaders.

\

Of late, Jesus had seemed more morose and negative, saying things that seemed to Peter defeatist and unacceptable.

\

He felt under his cloak for his sword. As a fisherman, he had never had cause to use such a thing. But now, if Jesus was right about Judas --

\

He was going to have to do it.

\

He would _prove_ -- beyond the shadow of a doubt -- his total devotion to Jesus!
