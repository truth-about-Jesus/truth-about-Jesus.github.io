Meanwhile, Jesus' guard detail had gathered together the other soldiers under Pilate's command to "have a little fun" with the so-called "king of the Jews" -- and hopefully blow off some steam.

與此同時，耶穌的警衛人員召集了彼拉多指揮下的其他士兵，與所謂的“猶太人之王”“玩得開心”——並希望能夠發洩一下。

\

Military service in this barbaric land was replete with stresses and frustrations, after all. 

畢竟，在這片野蠻的土地上服兵役充滿了壓力和挫折感。

\

One of the more enterprising and creative of the soldiers had actually taken young branches from a thorn tree and woven them together to form a fitting "crown" for this pretender to Rome's sovereignty in the region.

一位更具進取心和創造力計程車兵實際上從荊棘樹上取下嫩枝，並將它們編織在一起，為這個羅馬在該地區主權的假想者形成一個合適的“皇冠”。

\

It would be a shame to let it go to waste.

讓它浪費掉太可惜了。

\

Deep, painful, still bleeding lacerations covered Jesus' back, legs -- and even the soles of His feet. 

深深的、痛苦的、仍在流血的撕裂傷覆蓋了耶穌的背部、腿——甚至他的腳底。

\

He was unsteady from blood loss and could hardly stand.

他因失血而不穩定，幾乎無法站立。

\

Still, His guard detail half-dragged, half-carried Him into the judgement hall where the entire cohort of Roman soldiers had gathered. 

儘管如此，他的警衛還是半拖著，半把他拖進了整個羅馬士兵聚集的審判大廳。

\

One of them positioned a "crown" bristling with long, sharp thorns on Jesus' head, being careful not to pierce his own hands.

\

Two others removed His bloodstained clothes and enrobed Him in a crimson military cloak.

\

Finally, a stiff reed was placed in His hand, to serve as a "royal sceptre."

\

Terrible, fiery pain urged Him to slip into unconsciousness, but Jesus forced Himself to sit where His guard detail had placed Him, as the soldiers, each in turn, knelt before Him in mock deference, loudly proclaiming, "Hail, King of the Jews!"

\

\
\

Each soldier, as he rose from his kneeling position, then made some gesture of contempt to impress his fellows.

\

The first merely spit in Jesus' face, thereby drawing raucous howls of laughter from his compatriots.

\

The next grabbed the reed out of Jesus' hand and rapped Him smartly on the head with it, causing the thorns on the crown to pierce His scalp. 

\

The soldiers' hilarity knew no bounds. 

\

\
\

Jesus sat quietly, not fighting back or resisting, but allowing Himself to fully experience the abuse... not because He thought He deserved it --

\

He knew He did not --

\

and certainly not because He enjoyed it --

\

in addition to the physical pain, He found it deeply hurtful to be so completely dishonoured and rejected by these tiny precious creatures which He Himself had carefully designed and created, and was even now sustaining with life and breath --

\

all of whom He could easily, instantly, with just one word or minuscule gesture, decimate to atoms at any time... if He so chose...

\

<center>💠<\center>

\
\

No. Jesus endured and embraced this abject humiliation simply because...

\

He cherished, with His Father, an ocean of love.
