Peter passed the broiled fish, then a honeycomb, to Mary, Jesus' mom, who offered them to her Son with a tender smile.

彼得把烤魚，然後是蜂窩，遞給耶穌的母親瑪麗，瑪麗帶著溫柔的微笑把它們遞給她的兒子。

\

As Jesus ate the proffered food -- *and it didn't fall to the floor!* -- everyone relaxed, and wide smiles began to brighten the entire upper room.

當耶穌吃著提供的食物時——食物沒有掉到地上！——每個人都放鬆了，許多燦爛的笑容開始照亮整個樓上的房間。

\

Now the Apostles crowded around, touching His clothes, hands and feet -- hugging Him -- singing, dancing, and praising God!

現在，使徒們圍著他，觸摸他的衣服、手和腳 —— 擁抱他 —— 唱歌、跳舞、讚美上帝！

##### *John 16:20-22 (NIV)*
###### \
20 "Very truly I tell you, you will weep and mourn while the world rejoices. You will grieve, but your grief will turn to joy.

21 A woman giving birth to a child has pain because her time has come; but when her baby is born she forgets the anguish because of her joy that a child is born into the world.

22 So with you: Now is your time of grief, but I will see you again and you will rejoice, and no one will take away your joy."

\

##### *John 16:20-22 (Chinese NET (T))*
###### 
20 我告訴你們嚴肅的真理，你們要痛哭、哀號，世界倒要喜樂。你們將要憂愁，然而你們的憂愁要變為喜樂。

21 婦人生產的時候會憂愁，因為她的時候到了；既生了孩子，就不再記念那苦楚，要為世上添了一個人而歡喜。

22 同樣，你們現在也是憂愁；但我要再見你們，你們的心就喜樂了，這喜樂沒有人能奪去。
