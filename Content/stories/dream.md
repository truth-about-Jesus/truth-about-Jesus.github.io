Pilate was annoyed. 

\

These insane Jews always had to have things done immediately!

\

Didn't they know a man needed his sleep?!

\

"Tell them to come back later!" he growled at young Lucius, his houseboy, who stood nervously in the doorway. 

\

Lucius disappeared for a few moments, then returned. 

\

"Th-they insist it is urgent, your Lordship." His hands twisted together. 

\

"Something about Passover and preparation and Sabbath and the like."

\

Pilate groaned and sat up in the early morning darkness.

\

He sighed, then glanced at his young wife, who had finally fallen asleep after much tossing and turning through the night. 

\

Sophia was a tender, sensitive soul.

\

Sometimes he wondered if he had done the right thing, bringing her to this backward, barbaric land. 

\

She had grown pale and withdrawn as the days and months had passed, missing the elegance and beauty of Rome -- and her close-knit family. 

\

Although... of late she had shown interest in the stories circulating about that young Jewish rabbi from Nazareth -- the one who had been making such a splash in Judea. 

\

Pilate had heard nothing but praise for Him from a certain centurion stationed in Capernaum in Galilee, whom they often invited to dine with them, that he might regale them with stories of how the young Jewish rabbi had healed not only the centurion's own servant, but many others as well. 

\

There were even outlandish but entertaining stories of this rabbi turning water into wine, walking on water, raising the dead, calming storms, feeding thousands....!

\

Pilate thought the reports rubbish, but Sophia, whom he loved dearly, glowed with enthusiasm whenever the name of this "miracle worker" came up. 

\

What was it again?

\

Jesus.

\
\

Pilate gave one last look at Sophia, who was still muttering and mumbling away in uneasy sleep.

\

If only he could stay.

\

But this was the price one must pay, he thought grimly as he pulled on his clothes in the hours before dawn. 

\

Duty calls. 

\

He sighed again, then headed to the judgement hall.

\
\

Sophia sat up suddenly, her eyes glazed over with terror, the cry of anguish with which she had awoken herself still ringing in her ears. 

\

"My Lady?"

\

Lucius stood respectfully in the doorway. 

\

She stared at him wildly at first, then came to herself. 

\

It had only been a dream!

\
\

"Lucius! Where is his Lordship?" she called anxiously. 

\

Lucius hesitated. He was well aware of the admiration his Lady held for the prisoner who had been brought in, bloody and bruised, by the Jewish authorities. 

\

Reading the hesitation etched on his troubled face, Sophia knew. 

\

Her nightmare was happening -- right now. 

\

She spoke more urgently and more commandingly than she ever had before in her life.

\

"Come, Lucius! You must carry a message to his Lordship for me!"
