Pilate was annoyed. 

彼拉多不高興了。

\

These insane Jews always had to have things done immediately!

這些瘋狂的猶太人總是必須立即完成事情！

\

Didn't they know a man needed his sleep?!

他們難道不知道一個男人需要睡覺嗎？！

\

"Tell them to come back later!" he growled at young Lucius, his houseboy, who stood nervously in the doorway. 

「叫他們一會兒回來！」他憤怒地對年輕的盧修斯說。盧修斯是他的男僕，緊張地站在門口。

\

Lucius disappeared for a few moments, then returned. 

盧修斯離開了一會兒，然後又回來了。

\

"Th-they insist it is urgent, your Lordship." His hands twisted together. 

「他們堅持認為這很緊急，大人。」 他雙手絞在一起。



\

"Something about Passover and preparation and Sabbath and the like."

「關於逾越節和準備以及安息日之類的東西。」

\

Pilate groaned and sat up in the early morning darkness. 

彼拉多呻吟著，在清晨的黑暗中坐了起來。

\

He sighed, then glanced at his young wife, who had finally fallen asleep after much tossing and turning through the night. 

他嘆了口氣，然後瞥了一眼他的年輕妻子，她在經歷了一夜的折後終於睡著了。

\

Sophia was a tender, sensitive soul.

索菲亞是個溫柔、敏感的靈魂。

\

Sometimes he wondered if he had done the right thing, bringing her to this backward, barbaric land. 

有時他想知道他是否做了正確的事情，把她帶到了這片落後的野蠻土地上。

\

She had grown pale and withdrawn as the days and months had passed, missing the elegance and beauty of Rome -- and her close-knit family. 

幾個月過去了，她變得蒼白、孤僻，懷念羅馬的優雅和美麗以及她親密的家庭。

\

Although... of late she had shown interest in the stories circulating about that young Jewish rabbi from Nazareth -- the one who had been making such a splash in Judea. 

儘管……最近她對流傳的關於那位來自拿撒勒的年輕猶太拉比的故事表現出了興趣——這位拉比在該地區引起了轟動。

\

Pilate had heard nothing but praise for Him from a certain centurion stationed in Capernaum in Galilee, whom they often invited to dine with them, that he might regale them with stories of how the young Jewish rabbi had healed not only the centurion's own servant, but many others as well. 

彼拉多只聽到一位駐紮在加利利迦百農的某個百夫長對他的讚美，他們經常邀請他與他們一起用餐，他可能會向他們講述這位年輕的猶太拉比如何不僅治癒百夫長自己的僕人，還治癒了許多其他人的故事。

\

There were even outlandish but entertaining stories of this rabbi turning water into wine, walking on water, raising the dead, calming storms, feeding thousands....!

甚至有古怪但有趣的故事，這位拉比把水變成酒，在水面上行走，復活死者，平息暴風雨，餵養成千上萬......！

\

Pilate thought the reports rubbish, but Sophia, whom he loved dearly, glowed with enthusiasm whenever the name of this "miracle worker" came up. 

彼拉多認為這些報道是垃圾，但每當這個“奇蹟工作者”的名字出現時，他深愛的索菲亞就會熱情洋溢。

\

What was it again?

他又叫什麼名字？

\

*Jesus.*

耶穌。

\
\

Pilate gave one last look at Sophia, who was still muttering and mumbling away in uneasy sleep.

彼拉多最後看了索菲亞一眼，她仍在不安的睡夢中咕噥著。

\

If only he could stay.

要是他能留下來就好了。

\

But this was the price one must pay, he thought grimly as he pulled on his clothes in the hours before dawn. 

但這是一個人必須付出的代價，在黎明前的幾個小時裡，他一邊穿上衣服，一邊冷酷地想。

\

Duty calls. 

我們都必須盡到自己的職責。

\

He sighed again, then headed to the judgement hall. 

他再次嘆了口氣，然後前往審判大廳。

\
\

Sophia sat up suddenly, her eyes glazed over with terror, the cry of anguish with which she had awoken herself still ringing in her ears. 

索菲亞突然坐了起來，她的雙眼充滿了恐懼，她醒來時的痛苦呼喊仍然在她耳邊響起。

\

"My Lady?"

「我的女士？」

\

Lucius stood respectfully in the doorway. 

盧修斯恭敬地站在門口。

\

She stared at him wildly at first, then came to herself. 

起初，她瘋狂地盯著他，然後又神來了。

\

It had only been a dream!

這只是一個夢！

\

\
\

"Lucius! Where is his Lordship?" she called anxiously. 

「盧修斯！州長在哪裡？」她焦急地問。

\

Lucius hesitated. He was well aware of the admiration his Lady held for the prisoner who had been brought in, bloody and bruised, by the Jewish authorities. 

盧修斯猶豫了。他很清楚州長的妻子對猶太當局帶來的血淋淋、傷痕累累的囚犯的欽佩。

\

Reading the hesitation etched on his troubled face, Sophia knew. 

讀到他煩惱臉上的猶豫不決，索菲亞知道。

\

Her nightmare was happening -- *right now.* 

她的噩夢正在發生——現在。

\

She spoke more urgently and more commandingly than she ever had before in her life.

她說話的語氣比她一生中任何時候都更加急迫和威嚴。

\

"Come, Lucius! You must carry a message to his Lordship for me!"

「來吧，盧修斯！你必須幫我給州長帶個口信！」
