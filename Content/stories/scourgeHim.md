When Jesus arrived back at the governor's judgement hall, flanked by the Roman guard detail and trailed by His accusers, Pilate sighed. 

當耶穌回到總督的法庭時，耶穌被羅馬衛兵包圍，控告他的人跟在他身後。彼拉多嘆了口氣。

\

He'd enjoyed the brief moment of respite from one of the biggest headaches he'd ever had to deal with. 

這種情況是彼拉多經歷過的最麻煩的情況之一。他短暫的休息結束了。

\

It wasn't every day that his wife actually took an interest in his work -- let alone spoke up for a prisoner under his judgement. 

他的妻子並不是每天都對他的工作感興趣，更不用說為受審的囚犯說話了。

\

In fact -- Sophia had *never* shown *any* interest in his work -- until now. 

事實上——索菲亞從未對他的工作表現出任何興趣——直到現在。

\

And all because of a dream, no less!

這一切都是因為一個夢想，不亞於！

\

He sighed again, knowing that Caiaphas, like a dog with a bone, would not let go until he had coerced Pilate -- covertly, of course -- into getting rid of his chief competition for him. 

他再次嘆了口氣，知道該亞法就像一條有骨頭的狗一樣，除非他脅迫彼拉多——當然是秘密的——擺脫他的主要競爭，否則他才會放手。

While Jesus had been gone, Pilate had come to the conclusion that -- for whatever reason -- the mob of Jews outside seemed to feel strongly that Jesus *must* be punished. 

在他短暫的休息期間，彼拉多得出的結論是，無論出於什麼原因，外面的猶太人似乎強烈地認為耶穌必須受到懲罰。

\

Hoping to defuse the mob's anger by meting out to Jesus a lesser punishment -- yet still one horrific enough to satisfy their anger --

他希望透過對耶穌施加較輕的懲罰來安撫暴徒——雖然懲罰仍然可怕，足以平息他們的憤怒——

\

at the same time, hoping to satisfy his wife by not actually executing Jesus, he spoke.

同時，他希望透過不實際處決耶穌來讓妻子滿意。彼拉多講話了。

\

"Scourge Him."

｢鞭爈他。｣

\

Jesus winced inside as He heard the words. 

耶穌聽了這些話，感到很不安。

\

He was not looking forward to this next part of His and His Father's plan. 

他知道他不會享受他與天父所製定的計劃的下一部分。

\

It was one thing to draw up blueprints for an ingenious rescue in the comfort and convenience of Heaven, surrounded by thousands of angels just waiting to do One's bidding. 

在天堂的舒適和便利中為巧妙的救援繪製藍圖是一回事，周圍是成千上萬的天使，他們只是等待服從他的命令。

\

It was wholly another to implement the plan on earth -- still surrounded by thousands of angels waiting to do His bidding, but now also by thousands of demons gloating and frothing at the mouth as they gleefully anticipated the torture of the hated Son of God.

在地球上執行這個計劃完全是另一回事——仍然被成千上萬的天使包圍著等待執行他的命令，但現在也被成千上萬的惡魔包圍著，他們幸災樂禍，口吐白沫，因為他們很高興看到上帝的兒子受到折磨。

\

He would not give in. 

他不會屈服的。

\

He would obey His Father. 

他決心服從父親。
