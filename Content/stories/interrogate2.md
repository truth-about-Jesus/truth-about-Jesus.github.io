"Where are You from?" Pilate demanded abruptly, as soon as the guard detail had hustled Jesus back inside. He was angry with Caiaphas for withholding a crucial piece of evidence until now. 

“你來自哪裡？” 彼拉多一把警衛趕回裡面，就突然要求。 他對該亞法一直隱瞞了關鍵證據感到憤怒。

\

The prisoner didn't answer, but only looked at him. 

囚犯沒有回答，只是看著他。

\

Pilate sighed. 

彼拉多嘆了口氣。

\

*This prisoner seemed to have a death wish!*

這個囚犯似乎有一個死亡願望！

\

"You refuse to speak to me? Don't You know I have the authority to crucify or release You?"

「你拒絕和我說話？ 難道你不知道我有權把你釘在十字架上或釋放你嗎？」

\

Now Jesus spoke, gently and reassuringly, as if He sensed the Roman governor's fear. 

現在，耶穌溫柔而令人放心地說話，好像他感受到了羅馬總督的恐懼。

\

"You would have no authority over Me unless it had been given to you from above; therefore, the one who handed Me over to you has committed the greater sin."

「除非從上面賜給你，否則你對我沒有任何權威；因此，把我交給你的人犯了更大的罪。」

\

Something inside Pilate broke. 

就在那一刻，彼拉多內心有什麼東西崩潰了。

\

He felt like crying, though he didn't understand why.

他想哭，儘管他不明白為什麼。

\

If only the situation were different -- he and Jesus could have been meeting as young soldiers in training together, or as shipmates serving as crew aboard the same military vessel, or --

如果情況不同就好了——他和耶穌本可以作為一起訓練的年輕士兵見面，或者作為在同一艘軍艦上擔任船員的船友，或者——

\

*anything* but this.

除了這個，任何東西。
