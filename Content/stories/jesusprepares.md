title: 8 - Jesus prepares  è€¶ç©Œæº–å‚™
---

By now it was late, and they were all full of roast lamb and flatbread, dipping sauce and wine, yet Jesus kept leading them onward. 

\

John thought fleetingly of his bed -- really only a mat on the floor at the place where they were staying -- but chose to keep focus on his Lord.

\

He didn't understand, but it seemed as if Jesus was intent on finishing something important -- tonight.

\

Jesus led them onward, over the brook and beyond, into the garden of Gethsemane where they had met many times before. 

\

He seemed sombre as He spoke to His eleven remaining Apostles.

\

"Sit here, while i go pray."

\

 He stopped Peter, James and John, as they were about to sit with the others.

\

"You three... please... come with Me," He said gently.

\
\

He led the three of them to a different part of the garden, then allowed Himself to feel His grief and distress more fully in their presence. 

\

"My soul is sorrowful -- to death. Wait for Me here; watch with Me."

\
\

As Peter, James and John settled themselves where their Master had indicated, Jesus went further into the garden, His tumultuous emotions impelling Him to seek His Father in prayer. 

\

He knew His Father -- God -- could do anything. Perhaps He might be spared from this terrible suffering...

\
\

Withdrawing even further into the garden, He fell to the ground a distance away from the place where He had left His three most trusted companions. 

\

Now He was alone, in the presence of His Father. 

\

Great tears welled up in His eyes, then spilled to the ground as His whole body began to heave and shudder with intense sorrow and overwhelming fear. He groaned under the unbearable weight of soul-crushing grief; His sweat became drops of blood squeezing through the pores of His skin, falling to earth, mingling with His tears...

\

When at last He could speak, He gasped out a prayer to His beloved, faithful Father. 

\

"Abba... Father... You can do anything... please... take this cup away from Me..."

\

Sorrow wracked His body for a good long time now, as He poured out His trouble wordlessly to God. 

\

When again He was calm enough to speak, Jesus continued.

\

"Yet not My will..." He struggled to tame His body's natural fear response to the suffering He knew was imminent.

\

"But... Yours... be done."

\
\

Calm again for the moment, Jesus headed back to where His three closest friends were praying...

\

only to discover them all snoring gently. 

\

He was not surprised -- He understood their weakness -- but tonight was going to be the worst of their lives, too, and they would need the strength that only prayer could bring. 

\

"You're sleeping, Simon," He said to Peter, calling him by his old name rather than by the new one He had given him. Peter was anything but a rock at this moment. 

\

"You couldn't even watch with Me for one hour?"

\

Peter stared at Jesus through bleary eyes. He had fallen soundly asleep and had been dreaming of happier times -- of fishing in a boat with Jesus as one of his crew, pulling in a wonderful catch of fish...

\

"Stay awake, and pray, lest you enter into temptation. The spirit is willing and ready, but the flesh is weak."

\
\

Once the three Apostles were awake and praying once again, Jesus headed back to wrestle with His Father yet further.

\

He needed to know -- for sure -- that there was no other option, because if there were any other way to save the world, He would definitely take it!

\

Again, tears and groans wracked His body as He laid His case before His Father. Surely there must be some other, less horrific solution to the problem of mankind's sin.

\

But there wasn't.

\
\

When He returned a third time and found His Apostles sleeping yet again, Jesus was calm. 

\

He was now resigned to His fate... the plan He and His Father had crafted together... before creating the earth. 

\

He knew there was no other way... no other solution.

\

And He loved His Father more than He hated the pain, humiliation, suffering and death filling the cup placed before Him. 

\

He would drink it... to the dregs.

\

\
\

"You may as well sleep now." He spoke over the Apostles' peaceful snores.

\

Then, as a group of men carrying torches and weapons approached, He shook them all awake.

\

"It's time now: the Son of Man is handed over to sinners. Get up! Let's go.

\

"Look! My betrayer is here."
