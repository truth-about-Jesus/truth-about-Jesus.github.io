The two Marys -- Magdalene and Jesus' mom -- were up early, before dawn.

兩個瑪麗——抹大拉和耶穌的媽媽——在黎明前很早就起床了。

\

Now that the Sabbath was past, they were intent on doing what should have been done earlier: anointing Jesus' body with aromatic ointments and spices.

現在安息日已經過去，他們打算做早該做的事情：用芳香的軟膏和香料塗抹耶穌的身體。

\

They had not wanted to ask any of the men to accompany them, even though John in particular had been unfailingly kind. All were still devastated and grief-stricken by the appalling torture, crucifixion and death of their Lord.

他們不想請任何人陪同他們，儘管約翰特別善良。 所有人都仍然被他們主的可怕的酷刑、釘十字架和死亡所摧毀和悲傷。

\

Mary Magdalene sometimes thought men *-- but not Jesus! --* were rather weak when their emotions came into play.

抹大拉的瑪麗有時會認為男人——但不是耶穌！——當他們的情緒發揮作用時，他們相當軟弱。

\

Not that *she* wasn't equally devastated and grief-stricken: She *was*. 

並不是說她沒有同樣崩潰和悲傷：她是。

\

But somehow, she was able to carry on. Of course, the authorities would not be looking for women, but men, if they were hunting Jesus' followers.

但不知何故，她能夠繼續下去。 當然，如果當局追捕耶穌的追隨者，他們不會尋找女性，而是尋找男性。

\

She supposed that was an advantage.

她意識到這是一個優勢。

\

"Who will help us roll away that big heavy stone?" she wondered aloud.

“誰來幫我們滾掉那塊又大又重的石頭？” 她大聲地想知道。

\

Jesus' mother shook her head. 

耶穌的母親搖了搖頭。

\

Deep down, though, underneath the intense, unrelenting agony of losing her beloved Son in such a horrifying way...

然而，在內心深處，在以如此可怕的方式失去她心愛的兒子的強烈、無情的痛苦之下......

\

Mary had an unmistakable sense that, somehow, some way, God would provide.

瑪麗強烈地感覺到上帝將會以某種方式幫助他們。

As they arrived at the garden where Jesus' body lay entombed, the earth shook violently, and they clutched at each other for support.

當他們到達安葬耶穌遺體的花園時，大地劇烈震動，他們互相抓住以支撐自己。

\

*Another* earthquake! It was very strange.

又一場地震！ 這很奇怪。

\

When the tremors ceased they ran the rest of the way to the tomb, stopping in amazement as it came into view. 

震動停止後，他們一路跑向墳墓，當墳墓出現在眼前時，他們驚訝地停了下來。

\

Their problem was solved.

他們的問題得到了解決。

\

The huge stone was rolled away. 

巨大的石頭被滾走了。
