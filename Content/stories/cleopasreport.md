"Did you also feel your heart burning inside, as He opened the prophetic writings to us?" asked Theudas, as the two disciples hurried joyfully back to Jerusalem.

「當他向我們開啟預言性著作時，你是否也感覺到你的內心在燃燒？」 特烏達問道，兩個門徒高興地匆匆趕回耶路撒冷。

\

It was still the selfsame night they had left the Apostles, met the stranger, and arrived home in Emmaus. 

那還是他們離開使徒們、遇見那個陌生人並返回艾瑪烏斯村的家的那個晚上。

\

"Of *course,* i did!" replied Cleopas fervently. 

「當然，我做到了！」 克利奧帕斯熱情地回答。

\

He pondered for a moment. 

他沉思了一會兒。

\

"But -- *how* did we not *recognize* Him?"

「但是——我們怎麼沒認出他？」

\

"At first we didn't know Him -- we only saw a stranger --"

「起初，我們不認識他——我們只看到一個陌生人——」

\

They were back in the upper room in Jerusalem, surrounded by wide-eyed Apostles.

他們已經回到耶路撒冷的樓上房間，周圍都是睜大眼睛的使徒們。

\

"But as He walked with us, He helped us understand the Holy Writings about the Messiah, how He *had* to suffer and die --"

「但當他與我們同行時，他幫助我們理解了關於彌賽亞的預言，以及他為什麼必須受苦和死去——」

\

Cleopas struggled to compose himself.

克利奧帕斯努力讓自己變得鎮心。

\

"Then, as we were at the table together, He took the bread, blessed it, broke it, and gave it to us --"

「然後，當我們一起坐在餐桌上時，他拿著麵包，祝福它，掰了它，然後給了我們——」

\

His voice faltered; the tears came.

他的聲音搖搖欲墜；眼淚流了下來。

\

Theudas took up the account.

特烏達接管了故事。

\

"At that moment, our eyes were opened -- 

「那一刻，我們的眼睛睜開了——

\

and we recognized -- *Jesus!*

我們認出了——耶穌！

\

Then, He just --

然後，他只是——

\

*vanished!"*

消失了！」
