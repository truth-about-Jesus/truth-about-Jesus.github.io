Mary Magdalene ran as fast as she could.

抹大拉的馬利亞儘可能快地跑。

\

Rivers of tears obscured her vision, but she didn't care. 

淚水模糊了她的視線，但她不在乎。

\

She had to tell the Apostles the terrible news: Jesus' body had been *taken* from the tomb!

她不得不告訴使徒們這個可怕的訊息：耶穌的屍體被從墳墓裡帶走了！

\

\
\

The atmosphere in the upper room, where the Apostles had enjoyed that last, precious, Passover meal with their beloved Lord, was sombre and still.

樓上的房間裡，曾有宗徒們與他們敬愛的主一起享用過最後的、珍貴的逾越節晚餐，現在氣氛莊重而寂靜。

\

What was there to say? They all knew they had failed Him: falling asleep while He prayed alone, and then abandoning Him in His hour of greatest need. 

有什麼好說的？他們都知道自己辜負了他：當他獨自祈禱時，他們睡著了，然後在他最需要他們的時候拋棄了他。

\

Peter sat apart from the others, knowing he had done far worse -- denying he even *knew* Jesus -- *three times!*

彼得和其他人分開坐著，知道自己做得更糟糕——否認他甚至認識耶穌——三次！

\

When the chips were down, he, Peter -- the *"rock"!* -- had been more like a soft, slippery mud -- giving way, and not supporting His beloved Master at all.

當困難來臨時，他，彼得——“岩石”！——更像是一片柔軟、滑溜溜的泥巴——讓路，根本不支援他心愛的主人。

\

\
\

"They -- *what?!"*

「他們——什麼？！」

\

John couldn't believe his ears. 

約翰簡直不敢相信自己的耳朵。

\

As Mary Magdalene tried again to relate the startling news about Jesus' body, Peter pushed past him. 

當抹大拉的馬利亞再次試圖講述有關耶穌屍體的令人不安的消息時，彼得推開他們，從敞開的門出去。

\

"Let's *go!"*

「我們走吧！」

\

\
\

Now Peter and John were running together, racing toward the sepulchre.

現在，彼得和約翰一起奔跑，向墳墓跑去。

\

Being younger and more agile, John got there first. He looked inside, but hesitated to enter.

約翰更年輕、更敏捷，他先到了那裡。 他往裡看，但猶豫著要不要進去。

\

He saw the linen cloth that had been wrapped around Jesus' body lying empty, and the cloth that had covered His face, folded separately.

他看見之前包裹耶穌身體的亞麻布空了，之前遮蓋耶穌臉的布也分開疊好了。

\

When Peter arrived, he went straight into the tomb -- then stopped and stared.

當彼得到達時，他直接進入墳墓——然後停下來盯著。

\

Where was Jesus' body? Who could have taken it?

耶穌的屍體在哪裡？誰拿走了它？

\

He heaved a huge sigh.

他深深地嘆了口氣。

\

As if things hadn't been horrible enough, now *this* had to happen.

好像事情還不夠糟糕，現在又發生了這件新事。

\

\
\

Mary, Jesus' mother, was making her way back to the house where the Apostles were staying. 

耶穌的母親馬利亞正要回到使徒們住的房子。

\

The angel had given her and Mary Magdalene the most wonderful news. Her Son was *alive!*

天使給了她和抹大拉的馬利亞最美妙的訊息。 她的兒子還活著！

\

He had risen -- from *death!*

他從死裡復活了！

\

The very thought was mind-boggling --

這個想法令人匪夷所思——

\

but -- 

但是--

\

He had raised *others* from death. Why *shouldn't* He Himself be raised?

他使其他人從死裡復活。 為什麼他自己不應該被撫養呢？

\

Her mother heart was bubbling over with almost unbearable joy.

她母親的心因幾乎無法忍受的喜悅而跳動。

\

The angel had reminded them of what He'd told them in Galilee:

天使提醒他們他在加利利告訴他們的事情：

\

"It is necessary for the Son of Man to be betrayed into the hands of sinful men, to be crucified, and to *rise again* on the third day."

「人子必須被交在罪人手裡，被釘在十字架上，第三天復活。」

\

Mary Magdalene had taken off running as soon as the angel had gone. Jesus' mother imagined she was already sharing the marvellous angelic message with the Apostles.

天使一走，抹大拉的馬利亞就跑了。 耶穌的母親想象著她已經在與使徒們分享奇妙的天使資訊。

\

As expected, she soon saw Peter and John, trailed by Mary Magdalene, racing back toward the garden.

正如她所料，她很快就看到彼得和約翰，後面跟著抹大拉的瑪利亞，正跑回花園。

\

Let the young folks run.

讓年輕人跑。

\

It was a joyous occasion, after all!

畢竟，這是一個快樂的時刻！
