Over two thousand years ago, a certain Man appeared on the human scene.

兩千多年前，一個人出現在人類舞臺上。

\

In many ways He was nothing special... just a poor carpenter from the wrong side of town in an occupied territory. He was uneducated, never married or had children, never made much money.

在許多方面，他沒有什麼特別之處......只是一個來自被佔領土上城鎮另一側的可憐的木匠。 他沒有受過教育，從未結婚或生過孩子，也從未賺過很多錢。

\

At age 30, He began to teach and help His people; only three years later, He was condemned and executed like a common criminal.

30歲時，他開始教導和幫助他的人民；僅僅三年後，他就像普通罪犯一樣被定罪和處決。

\

Yet today, billions of people -- across the globe, from all walks of life -- claim to be His followers. 

然而，今天，來自全球各行各業的數十億人聲稱自己是他的追隨者。

\

Why?

為什麼？

\

His story was recorded in detail, by eyewitnesses who knew Him personally, in the first four books of the New Testament -- the gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John -- in the Bible.

他的故事由親自認識他的目擊者在《聖經》的《新約》的前四本書——《馬太福音》、《馬可福音》、《路加福音》和《約翰福音》中詳細記錄。

\

This book is a dramatization of the essence of His story.

這本書把他故事的精髓戲劇化了。

##### _John 20:30-31 (ESV)_

30 Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book;

31 but these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.

\

##### _John 20:30-31 (Chinese NET (T))_

30 耶穌在門徒面前，另外行了許多神蹟，沒有記在這書上。

31 但這裏記着的，要叫你們信耶穌是基督，是 神的兒子；並且因着信，你們就可以因他的名得生命。
