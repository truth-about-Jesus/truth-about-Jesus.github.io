Caiaphas waited impatiently as Pilate took his time settling himself on the judgement seat.

當彼拉多在審判席上安頓下來時，該亞法不耐煩地等待著。

\

At last, Pilate looked at him, and at the prisoner who had been thrust forward by the Temple guards. 

最後，彼拉多看著他，看著被聖殿守衛推上前的囚犯。

\

"What accusation do you bring against this man?"

「你對這個人提出了什麼指控？」

\

Caiaphas paused, knowing Jesus had done nothing at all against Roman law.

該亞法停頓了一下，知道耶穌沒有做任何違反羅馬律法的事情。

\

"If He were not an evildoer, we would not have brought Him to you," he hedged finally, hoping to move quickly on from this point to the threat of riot, when he would have the upper hand.

「如果他不是一個作惡者，我們就不會把他帶到你身邊，」他終於對沖了，希望從這一點迅速轉向騷亂的威脅，當他佔據上風時。

\

Pilate rolled his eyes. *Not again.* These Jews were always bringing prisoners to him who had done nothing wrong, as far as he could see -- except offending their religious sensibilities!

彼拉多翻了個白眼。 他們又這麼做了！ 這些猶太人總是把囚犯帶到他面前，在他看來，他們沒有做錯任何事——除了冒犯他們的宗教感情！

\

He stood.

他站著。

\

"This is obviously not a concern for Rome. Take Him away and judge Him according to your own law!" he growled, angry to have been rousted out of bed so early in the morning for such trivialities.

「這顯然與羅馬無關。 把他帶走，按照你們自己的法律審判他！」 他煩躁地說，因為這些小事這麼早就被從床上爬起來，他很生氣。

\

Like a chess player, Caiaphas made his next move.

像棋手一樣，該亞法斯邁出了下一步行動。

\

"We have no authority to put a man to death," he explained, knowing the mention of a death sentence would pique the governor's interest.

「我們沒有權力處死一個人，」他解釋說，因為他知道提到死刑會激起州長的興趣。

\

*Death?* thought Pilate with surprise. *What could this man have done?*

處死？ 彼拉多驚訝地想。 這個人做了什麼？

\

He gestured to his own soldiers, who took the prisoner from the Temple guards and brought him inside the judgement hall. 

他向自己的士兵做了個手勢，士兵從聖殿衛兵手中帶走了囚犯，並把他帶進了審判廳。

\

Pilate turned again to Caiaphas. 

彼拉多再次轉向該亞法。

\

"What is his name?"

「他叫什麼名字？」

\

*"Jesus."*

「耶穌。」

\

\
\

*Jesus?*

耶穌？

\

Pilate's mind whirled with possibilities as he followed the prisoner inside. 

彼拉多跟著囚犯進去，腦子裡充滿了各種可能性。

\

Caiaphas had accused Him of claiming to be the king of the Jews. 

該亞法指責他聲稱自己是猶太人的國王。

\

Yet his own centurion in Capernaum had not reported any such claim, which would, of course, be considered a potential threat to Rome's sovereignty in the region. 

然而，他自己在迦百農的百夫長沒有報告任何此類主張，當然，這被認為是對羅馬在該地區主權的潛在威脅。

\

He wondered. 

他想知道。

\

\
\

"Are You the king of the Jews?" he asked Jesus bluntly, hoping to surprise Him into giving an honest response. 

「你是猶太人的國王嗎？」 他直言不諱地問耶穌。他希望耶穌會感到驚訝並給出誠實的答案。

\

Jesus looked at Pilate intently, already knowing what the response to His next words would be. 

耶穌專注地看著彼拉多，他已經知道彼拉多對他接下來的話會有什麼反應。

\

"Is this from yourself, or did others say this about Me?"

「這是你的想法，還是別人這麼說我的？」

\

"Am i a Jew?" retorted Pilate angrily. "Your own nation and chief priests have handed You over to me!"

「我是猶太人嗎？」彼拉多憤怒地反駁。 「你自己的國家和祭司長已經把你交給我了！」

\

"What did You do?" he pressed, thinking that this poor, bloody and bruised man did not appear to be enjoying any of the trappings of kingship. 

「你做了什麼？」他堅持說。他覺得這個可憐的、血淋淋的、遍體鱗傷的男人似乎沒有任何王權的標誌。

\
\

As if in response to Pilate's thought -- *but there was no way He could have known!* thought Pilate -- Jesus spoke clearly and decisively. 

好像是為了迴應彼拉多的想法——但他不可能知道！ 彼拉多想——耶穌說話清晰而果斷。

\

"My kingdom is not of this world; if it were, My officers would have fought to stop the Jews from arresting Me; at this moment, My kingdom is not from here."

「我的王國不是這個世界的；如果是的話，我的軍官們會為阻止猶太人逮捕我而戰鬥；此時此刻，我的王國不是來自這裡。」

\

Pilate digested this surprising statement.

彼拉多消化了這個令人驚訝的陳述。

\

"So... You *are* a king, then?" Pilate questioned, wondering what Jesus meant by "at this moment"...

「所以...... 那麼，你是個國王嗎？」彼拉多質疑，想知道耶穌所說的「此時此刻」是什麼意思......

\

He knew he must gauge carefully any threat posed to Caesar's empire, regardless of any admiration his wife -- and even he himself, he admitted grudgingly -- held for this man.

他知道他必須仔細衡量對凱撒帝國構成的任何威脅，不管他的妻子——甚至他自己，他勉強承認——對這個人抱有任何欽佩。

\

"You have said that i am a king," Jesus responded enigmatically. 

「你說我是國王，」耶穌神秘地回答。

\

He paused, then continued. 

他停頓了一下，然後繼續。

\

"To this i was born, and for this i have come into the world: that i may testify to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears My Voice."

「為此，我出生了，為此我來到了這個世界：以便我可以證明真相。 每個真理的人都會聽到我的聲音。」

\
\

*Ah!* thought Pilate. He is a philosopher! That explains everything.

啊！ 彼拉多想。 他是個哲學家！ 這解釋了一切。

\

"What is truth?" he commented offhandedly, as he stood and prepared to go back outside to where the Jews waited impatiently for a verdict. 

「什麼是真理？」他冷漠地評論。他站起來，準備回到外面，猶太人在那裡焦急地等待判決。
