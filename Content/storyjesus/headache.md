*What to do now?* he pondered.

現在該做什麼？ 他沉思著。

\

The Chief Priest had said something about Galilee... *of course!* This Jesus was from Nazareth in Galilee!

大祭司說了一些關於加利利的事……當然！這位耶穌來自加利利的拿撒勒！

\

That was *Herod's* jurisdiction!

\

And Herod was visiting in Jerusalem at this very moment.

\

Pilate beckoned to an aide, "Have the prisoner taken to King Herod."

Let Herod deal with this dilemma -- or at least delay the inevitable...

When the guard detail had taken the prisoner away, Pilate breathed a sigh of relief.

當警衛將囚犯帶走時，彼拉多鬆了一口氣。

He felt something clutched tightly in his hand, and opened it.

It was the note from his wife, Sophia.

這是他妻子索菲亞的便條。

He uncrumpled it and looked at it again:

他打開它，又讀了一遍：

\

*Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for i have suffered much today in a dream on His account.*

「不要和那個義人有任何關係，因為我今天在夢中為他受了很多苦」
