When Jesus was extremely popular, every time He showed up anywhere in Galilee, huge crowds of people immediately formed around Him, following Him and wanting to be close to Him.

當耶穌非常受歡迎時，每次他出現在加利利的任何地方，他周圍都會立即形成一大群人，跟隨他，並想接近他。

\
\

One day, a Very Important Person -- the synagogue leader -- with an Extremely Urgent Problem -- his twelve-year-old daughter was dying -- came to Jesus and asked Him to come to his house and touch her, so that she would be healed.

有一天，一個非常重要的人——猶太教堂的領袖——有一個極其緊急的問題——他十二歲的女兒快死了——來到耶穌身邊，請他來他家摸她，這樣她就會痊癒。

\

<center>💠</center>

\
\

Meanwhile, at the same time, a very *un*important person -- with no position or title or role, in the synagogue or anywhere else --

與此同時，一個非常不重要的人——在猶太教堂或其他任何地方沒有職位、頭銜或角色——

\

who had suffered from nonstop bleeding for twelve years,

她連續流血了十二年，

\

heard that Jesus was passing through (on His way to the synagogue leader's house).

她聽說耶穌經過（在去會堂負責人家的路上）。

\

She (the very unimportant person) had spent all her money on doctors, who had tried all sorts of procedures to stop her bleeding. But they had only succeeded in causing her much suffering and making the bleeding worse...

她（這個非常不重要的人）把所有的錢都花在了醫生身上，醫生嘗試了各種程式來阻止她的出血。 但他們只是成功地給她帶來了很多痛苦，並使出血加劇了……

\

<center>💠</center>

\
\

Anyways, this poor, unimportant, bleeding (but not dying) woman managed to sneak up behind Jesus in the huge crowd that was pressing all around Him.

無論如何，這個可憐的、不重要的、流血的（但是沒死）女人設法偷偷溜到後面耶穌在人群中他身邊。

\

(How did she get through that huge crowd?

（她是如何度過那群人群的？

\

Maybe God sent His angels to open a way for her, because He wanted her to be healed that day.)

也許上帝派他的天使為她開闢一條道路，因為他希望她那天能痊癒。）

\

Anyways, this woman had the idea that if she only touched the edge of Jesus' clothes, she would be healed. 

無論如何，這個女人的想法是，如果她只觸控耶穌衣服的邊緣，她就會痊癒。

\

So somehow she did it. 

所以不知何故，她做到了。

\

And she was! She knew right away inside her body that the unending flow of blood had finally... *finally* stopped!

她是！ 她立即在體內知道，無休止的血液終於......終於停止了！

\

<center>💠</center>

\
\

But her feelings of triumph and joy turned immediately to dread, because right at that moment, Jesus stopped, and turned around. 

但她的勝利和喜悅立刻變成了恐懼，因為就在那一刻，耶穌停了下來，轉過身來。

\

“Who touched my clothes?”

「誰動了我的衣服？」

\

His disciples were like, “How can You ask such a question, Jesus? *Everyone's* trying to touch You!”

他的門徒說：「耶穌，你怎麼能問這樣的問題？ 每個人都想碰你！」

\

And Jairus (the synagogue leader) was probably all, *O hurry, hurry, hurry!* inside, *before my daughter dies!* -- but he didn't actually say anything...

睚魯（猶太教堂的領袖）可能都是，「快點，快點，快點！」 裡面，「在我女兒死之前！」——但他實際上什麼也沒說......

\

Maybe the unimportant, now healed woman had been hoping just to touch Jesus, be healed, and slip away unnoticed...

也許這個不重要的、現已痊癒的女人只是想要觸摸耶穌痊癒了，然後想消失得無影無蹤……

\

She certainly hadn't meant to cause a scene...

她當然不是故意要製造一場戲……

\

How was she to know Jesus could even feel a touch *on the edge of His clothes?!*

她怎麼會知道耶穌甚至可以感覺到他衣服的邊緣被觸控了？！

\

<center>💠</center>

\
\

But Jesus kept looking around to see who had touched Him,

但耶穌不停地環顧四周，看看誰碰過他，

\

and the unimportant woman started to realize that, somehow, she and her story were Very Important to Jesus...

這個不重要的女人開始意識到，不知何故，她和她的故事對耶穌來說非常重要……

\

even if to no one else...

即使她對其他人都不重要……

\

so even though she was terrified, she came forward and fell at the feet of the One who had healed her, 

因此，儘管她嚇壞了，她還是上前來，倒在治癒她的人的腳下，

\

and Jesus looked at her kindly and attentively,

耶穌親切而專注地看著她，

\

and she told what had happened to her, in a trembling voice, still frightened of how He -- and others -- were going to react. 

她用顫抖的聲音講述了她身上發生的事情，仍然害怕他和其他人的反應。

\

After He had heard her story, Jesus was glad for her and said, gently and kindly, “My daughter, your faith has given you life. Go in peace, and be healed from your illness.”

耶穌聽完她的故事後，為她感到高興，溫柔而親切地說：「我的女兒，你的信仰給了你生命。 平平安安地去吧，從疾病中痊癒。」

\
\

Meanwhile, poor, harried Jairus' worst fears were suddenly realized, as people from his house arrived at that very moment with awful news: they were too late!

與此同時，當一個男人帶著可怕的訊息從家裡走來時，窮人和擔憂的睚魯最糟糕的恐懼突然發生了： 他們太晚了！

\

His daughter had died. 

他的女兒去世了。

\

<center>💠</center>

\
\

Jairus couldn't think. 

睚魯無法思考。

\

His beautiful daughter? *Dead?!*

他漂亮的女兒？ 死了？！

\

“You've done all you can,” the people who had come from his house said to the grief-torn father consolingly -- or so they thought. “But there's nothing else to do. Better let the Teacher go and don't bother Him anymore...”

「你已經盡你所能了，」從他家來的人安慰著這位悲痛的父親說——或者他們這麼想。 「但沒有別的事可做。 最好讓老師走，不要再打擾他了……」

\

At that moment, Jesus turned to Jairus and said, “Don't be afraid. Just believe.”

那一刻，耶穌轉向睚魯，說：「不要害怕。 只要有信心。」

\

Then Jesus headed to Jairus' house. Jairus followed along numbly, hoping against hope because -- he couldn't yet accept the truth, and... Jesus was still acting like there was something to be done... 

然後耶穌去了睚魯的家。 睚魯麻木地跟著，即使他已經失去了希望，因為——他還不能接受真相，而且…… 耶穌仍然表現得好像有事情要做……

\

<center>💠</center>

\
\

When they got home, everyone was wailing and crying noisily, and it was almost too much for Jairus' fragile heart to bear. 

當他們回到家時，每個人都在哭泣和吵鬧地哭泣，這對睚魯脆弱的心來說幾乎太過了。

\

But Jesus took charge of the situation. 

但耶穌掌控了局勢。

\

“Why are you crying and making such a racket? This little one isn't dead; she's just sleeping!”

「你們為什麼哭著做這樣的球拍？ 這個小女孩沒有死；她只是在睡覺！」

\

This completely unexpected statement caught everyone by surprise. 

這個完全出乎意料的宣告讓每個人都措手不及。

\

“Really? Is this the Great Teacher and Healer everyone has been talking about?! He can't even tell the difference between death -- and sleep?”

「真的嗎？ 這是每個人都在談論的偉大老師和治癒者嗎？！ 他甚至分不清死亡和睡眠之間的區別？」

\

“Why -- He really has been oversold!”

「他畢竟沒那麼了不起！」

\

“He's nothing but a charlatan!”

「他只是個江湖騙子！」

\

And they started laughing derisively at the “now-debunked has-been”...

他們開始嘲笑「現在被揭穿的已經」……

\

<center>💠</center>

\
\

Undeterred, Jesus gently but firmly guided all the laughing, crying, mocking people out the door, permitting only the girl's mother and father, and three of His disciples -- Peter, James and John -- to remain. 

耶穌毫不畏懼，溫柔而堅定地引導所有笑聲、哭泣、嘲笑的人走出門外，只允許女孩的母親和父親，以及他的三個門徒——彼得、詹姆斯和約翰——留下來。

\

Phew! It was quiet at last.

唷！ 終於安靜了。

\

<center>💠</center>

\
\

Jairus tried to focus liquid eyes as his stricken wife seized his hand, and Jesus approached his daughter's body, which was lying still on the bed -- not moving or breathing, growing colder, Jairus imagined numbly, by the second.

當他悲痛欲絕的妻子抓住他的手時，睚魯試圖聚焦液體的眼睛，耶穌走近他女兒的屍體，她靜靜地躺在床上——一動不動，也沒有呼吸，變得越來越冷，睚魯麻木地想著，每一秒。

\

Jesus reached out and took the pale, limp hand. 

耶穌伸出手，握住那隻蒼白無力的手。

\

“Little girl, get up!”

「小姑娘，起來吧！」

\

<center>💠</center>

\
\

At that moment a wave of grief rose and threatened to engulf Jairus completely. The tears fell freely now, and he turned away -- when suddenly his wife's hand tightened on his, and he heard her choking, gasping cry...

在那一刻，一股悲傷的浪潮升起，幾乎要徹底吞噬睚魯。 淚水奪眶而出，他轉過身去，突然妻子的手握緊了他的手，他聽到她哽咽、喘息的哭聲……

\

<center>💠</center>

\
\

Turning back, peering through a river of tears, he saw -- was he dreaming?! -- his daughter with her eyes open, colour returning, sitting -- *up...?!*

回頭一看，淚流成河，他發現──他是在做夢嗎？ ——他的女兒睜開眼睛，臉色恢復，坐起來……？！

\

She hopped out of bed and ran quickly to her dumbfounded parents and they both hugged her so tightly that, after a while they *had* to believe it. 

她從床上跳起來，飛快地跑向目瞪口呆的父母，他們緊緊地擁抱著她，過了一會兒，他們不得不相信了。

\

She was alive. *Alive!*

她還活著。 活！

\

<center>💠</center>

\
\

Her stupefied parents could not do anything but hug their beloved daughter who had died and been so unexpectedly restored to them, so -- after warning them strongly not to tell anyone what had happened -- Jesus reminded them kindly to give her something to eat, before leaving with His disciples, closing the door gently behind them.

她驚呆了的父母無能為力，只能擁抱他們心愛的女兒，她已經死了，而且意外地又回到了他們身邊，所以——在強烈警告他們不要告訴任何人發生了什麼事之後——耶穌善意地提醒他們給她一些吃的，輕輕地關上他們身後的門，在與他的門徒離開之前。
