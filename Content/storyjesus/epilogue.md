##### _1 Peter 1:3-7 (ESV)_

3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! 

According to his great mercy, he has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,

4 to an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for you,

5 who by God's power are being guarded through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.

6 In this you rejoice, though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been grieved by various trials,

7 so that the tested genuineness of your faith—more precious than gold that perishes though it is tested by fire—may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ.

##### _1 Peter 1:3-7 (Chinese NET (T))_

3 願頌讚歸與 神、我們主耶穌基督的父！

他照自己的大憐憫，藉着耶穌基督死裏的復活，使我們重生在活的盼望裏，

4 就是那不能朽壞、不能玷污、不能衰殘、為你們存留在天上的基業。

5 你們這因信蒙 神能力保護的人，必能得着所預備到末世要顯現的救恩，

6 這為你們帶來大喜樂，雖然如今你們也許暫時在百般的試煉中受苦。

7 這些試煉顯出你們信心的真實，比那經得起火的試驗、最後仍要衰殘的金子更為寶貴，必能在耶穌基督顯現的時候，得着稱讚、榮耀和尊貴。
