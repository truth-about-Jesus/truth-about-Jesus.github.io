Once all the Apostles were safely away, Jesus held out His hands in a gesture of surrender. 

一旦所有使徒都安全離開，耶穌就伸出雙手投降。

\

The captain of the armed band, understanding, motioned to the one carrying the rope meant to secure the prisoner. 

武裝樂隊的隊長理解了，向拿著用來捆綁囚犯的繩子的人示意。

\

The young soldier advanced cautiously and, finding that the young rabbi no longer resisted, succeeded in binding His hands together. 

年輕的士兵小心翼翼地前進，發現年輕的拉比不再反抗，成功地將他的雙手綁在一起。

\

The whole group relaxed a little and prepared to move out. 

整個小組都放鬆了一點，準備搬出去。

When they arrived at the court of the Chief Priest, Malchus went to wash the blood off his face in the servants' quarters before returning to find out what would happen to the powerful young rabbi who had healed *him* -- the enemy.

當他們到達首席牧師的宮廷時，馬爾丘斯去僕人宿舍洗臉上的血，然後回來瞭解治癒他的有權勢的年輕拉比會發生什麼——敵人。

\

The other servants exclaimed in surprise at his bloody face. 

其他僕人對他血淋淋的臉大吃一驚。

\

"What happened? Did He *hit* you?"

「發生了什麼事？ 他打你了嗎？」

\

"No," Malchus returned shortly.

「不，」馬爾丘斯簡短地回答。

\

"He *healed* me."

「他治癒了我。」

\

His companions stared, waiting for an explanation, but none was forthcoming.

同伴們瞪大了眼睛，等待著他的解釋，但沒有得到任何回應。

\

Malchus himself was not sure what to think of the night's events.

馬爾丘斯本人不知道該如何看待當晚的事件。

\

But one thing was clear: this young rabbi -- Jesus of Nazareth -- was no ordinary human being, and certainly not the type Malchus was accustomed to apprehending.

但有一點很清楚：這位年輕的拉比——拿撒勒的耶穌——不是普通人，當然也不是馬爾丘斯習慣於逮捕的那種人。

\

They'd said he was a charlatan; now Malchus wasn't so sure.

他們說他是江湖騙子；現在馬爾丘斯不太確定了。

\

He didn't know what to think anymore.

他不知道該怎麼想了。

Once his shekels had been well and truly earned, Judas relaxed. He had been intending to depart for Decapolis as soon as the deed was done, but Jesus had taken him by surprise when He'd surrendered and allowed Himself to be restrained. 

現在他已經真正賺到了謝克爾，猶大就放鬆了。 他一直打算在行為完成後立即前往迪卡波利斯，但當耶穌投降並允許自己受到約束時，耶穌讓他措手不及。

\

Certain Jesus still had more tricks up His sleeve, Judas decided to stick around and see how his former Lord would confound His enemies. 

猶大確信耶穌還有更多的把戲，猶大決定留下來，看看他的前主會如何迷惑並逃脫他的敵人。

Peter stood outside the gate. 

彼得站在大門外。

\

He envied young John, who was related to someone in the Chief Priest's household by marriage, and had been admitted to the courtyard without question, while he, Peter, had been barred from entering.

他羨慕年輕的約翰，他因婚姻而與首席牧師家中的某人有親戚關係，並被毫無疑問地進入庭院，而他彼得則被禁止進入。

\

He waited patiently, knowing that when John missed him, he would return and arrange for him to be admitted. 

他耐心地等待著，知道當約翰想念他時，他會回來安排他進來。

\

While he waited he replayed in his mind the events in the garden.

當他等待時，他在腦海中重播了花園裡的事件。

\

Clearly, Jesus had *thwarted* His own rescue -- it boggled the mind!

顯然，耶穌挫敗了自己的拯救——這讓人目繇亂！

\

One almost had to think Jesus *meant* the negative, defeatist things He'd been saying lately... but *that* was impossible, for Peter *knew*, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that Jesus was the Messiah, the Prophet Moses had spoken of, the Son of God!

人們幾乎不得不認為耶穌的意思是他最近一直在說的消極的、失敗主義的話......但這是不可能的，因為彼得毫無疑問地知道，耶穌是彌賽亞，先知摩西所說的，上帝的兒子！

\

So -- *why?!?*

那麼——為什麼？！？
