It was time. 

是時候了。

\

Time to truly *earn* those Tyrian shekels. 

是時候真正賺取那些提利安謝克爾了。

\

Judas Iscariot led the band of men armed with swords and clubs, carrying torches to light the darkness, toward the entrance of the place where he knew Jesus was most likely to go with His chosen Apostles. 

猶大·加略帶著一群拿著劍和棍棒的人，拿著火把照亮黑暗，走向他知道耶穌最有可能與他揀選的使徒一起去的地方的入口。

\

*He* felt relatively safe, himself. 

他自己也感到相對安全。

\

He knew Jesus well enough to know He would not harm anyone. 

他非常瞭解耶穌，知道他不會傷害任何人。

\

These others, of course, did not know that.

當然，這些其他人並不知道這一點。

\

So they were armed to the teeth. 

所以他們全副武裝。

\

\

"The One whom i kiss is the one. Seize Him," he instructed the group calmly -- almost mechanically -- knowing they would not be able to hold Jesus any more than anyone else had. 

「我所親吻的就是那一位。抓住他，」他平靜地——幾乎是機械地——指示大家，知道他們無法比其他人更能抓住耶穌。

\

Jesus would slip through their grasp and be free, and he, Judas, would be fully legitimately thirty shekels richer. 

耶穌將從他們的手中溜走，獲得自由，而他，猶大，將完全合法地更富有三十舍客勒。

\

He imagined the Chief Priests complaining to him later that they still did not have Jesus in their custody. 

他想象著大祭司後來向他抱怨，他們仍然沒有監護耶穌。

\

"I did my part," he imagined himself explaining patiently. 

「我盡了自己的一份力量，」他想象自己耐心地解釋。

\

"I led your men right to Him -- even singled Him out by kissing Him on the cheek. It was *your* men who bungled the arrest."

「我把你的手下直接引向他——甚至透過親吻他的臉頰來挑出他。 是你的手下沒能逮捕他。」

\

Then he would leave Jerusalem and go live in... hmm -- maybe the Decapolis? -- and lavish his newfound wealth on epicurean delights...

然後他會離開耶路撒冷，去生活......嗯——也許是德卡波利斯？——並把他新發現的財富揮霍於美食......

\

As Judas led the band into the garden, they saw Jesus approaching, while the eleven Apostles, now fully awake, stood behind Him, watching and wary.

當猶大帶領樂隊進入花園時，他們看到耶穌走近，而十一個完全清醒的使徒站在他身後，他們警惕地看著。

\

"Who are you looking for?" Jesus asked.

「你們都在找誰？」 耶穌問道。

\

"Jesus of Nazareth!" growled the captain. 

「拿撒勒的耶穌！」 船長相當激烈地說。

\

"I am He," replied Jesus firmly.

「我就是他，」耶穌堅定地回答。

\

As soon as the words were out of Jesus' mouth, the entire band of armed men -- Judas included -- fell backward and tumbled to the ground, defenceless in the presence of the omnipotent Son of God.

這句話一從耶穌的口中說出來，整個武裝分子——包括猶大——就倒在了身後，在全能的上帝之子面前毫無防備地摔倒在地。

\

\
\

Even as he lay on his back on the ground, bowled over by Jesus' display of power, Judas Iscariot was delighted.

即使他仰面躺在地上，被耶穌展示的力量擊倒時，加略人猶大也很高興。

\

He had been right. Earning these shekels would be a piece of cake. Jesus would escape -- easily! -- and he, Judas, would soon be on his way to Decapolis -- with a clear conscience and plenty of silver. 

他是對的。 賺取這些謝克爾會很容易。 耶穌會逃跑——沒問題！——他，猶大，很快就會帶著問心無愧和大量的銀子去迪卡波利斯。

\

\
\

Jesus eased off His power, allowing them all to get back up again as quickly as they could. Now they stood, gripping their weapons tightly, with fear in their eyes.

耶穌放鬆了力氣，他們都盡快站了起來。現在他們站了起來，緊緊握著武器，眼神充滿了恐懼。

\

"Who are you looking for?" He asked again, in measured tones. The Apostles thought they had never seen Him looking more majestic than He did at that moment --

「你們都在找誰？」 他再次問道，語氣堅定。使徒們認為他們從未見過他比那一刻更威嚴——

\

not even, mused John in the midst of his awe, on the mountain with Moses and Elijah, when He had been transfigured before their eyes.

甚至，約翰在敬畏中沉思著，與摩西和以利亞一起在山上，當他在他們眼前變形時。

\
\

"Jesus of Nazareth," came the answer once again, the voice this time seeming to tremble a little.

「拿撒勒的耶穌，」答案再次出現，這次的聲音似乎有點顫抖。

\

"I told you that i am He," Jesus responded. 

「我告訴過你們，我就是他，」耶穌回答道。

\

"If it's Me you want, then let these others go."

「如果你們想要的是我，那就讓其他人走吧。」

\

The captain nodded, realizing they had no hope of arresting this powerful young rabbi unless He submitted voluntarily. 

隊長點了點頭，意識到除非他自願投降，否則他們沒有希望逮捕這位強大的年輕教員。

\

"Let the others go," he ordered his men, who jumped aside as most of the Apostles took the opportunity to escape...

「讓其他人走吧，」他命令他的手下。 當大多數使徒抓住機會逃跑時，士兵們跳到一邊......

\
\

Meanwhile, Peter unsheathed his sword. 

與此同時，彼得解開了劍鞘。

\

It was time for him to defend His Lord -- or die trying. 

是時候讓他捍衛他的主了——或者努力去死。

\

He slashed wildly toward the group, who stepped back, knowing they could easily handle this untrained fisherman but not wanting to antagonize the superior power they now recognized in Jesus. 

他瘋狂地向那群人砍去，他們退後一步，知道他們可以很容易地處理這個未經訓練的漁夫，但不想對抗他們現在在耶穌身上認識到的優越力量。

\

One of them, a servant of the High Priest named Malchus, was not so lucky. Although he attempted to sidestep Peter's amateurish slashing, he was not quite quick enough, and the sharpened sword somehow managed to slice off his ear. 

其中一位，大祭司馬爾庫斯的僕人，就沒有那麼幸運了。儘管他試圖避開彼得那業餘的砍擊，但他的速度不夠快，鋒利的劍不知怎的就割下了他的耳朵。

\

Before Malchus could even react, Jesus was standing between him and Peter. 

馬爾丘斯還沒來得及做出反應，耶穌就站在他和彼得之間。

\

"Put your sword away!" Jesus looked at Peter sternly. 

「把你的劍收起來！」 耶穌嚴厲地看著彼得。

\

"Shall i not drink the cup the Father has given Me?"

「我難道不喝父親給我的杯子嗎？」

\

Abashed, Peter lowered his bloody sword and stared. 

彼得不知道該怎麼想，放下血淋淋的劍，盯著耶穌。

\

It was almost as if Jesus *wanted* to be arrested!

就好像耶穌想被逮捕一樣！

\

Jesus quickly retrieved Malchus' severed ear from the ground and replaced it on his head, healing the wound so completely that -- except for the blood on Malchus' face and Peter's sword -- one could almost believe it had not actually happened. 

耶穌迅速將馬爾丘斯被割斷的耳朵從地上取回，並把它換到他的頭上，將傷口完全治癒，除了馬爾丘斯臉上的血和彼得的劍外，人們幾乎可以相信它實際上沒有發生。

\

\
\

Then Peter and the remaining Apostles bolted --

然後彼得和剩下的使徒們逃跑了——

\

leaving Jesus alone. 

讓耶穌獨處。
