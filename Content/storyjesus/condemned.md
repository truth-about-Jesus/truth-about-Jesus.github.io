*Aarrgh.* 

彼拉多非常沮喪。

\

As the increasingly uncontrolled cries of the crowd -- *"Crucify! Crucify!"* -- assaulted his senses, Pilate gestured abruptly to Lucius, who quickly approached.

當人群越來越不受控制的喊叫聲衝擊著他的感官時——「釘十字架！釘十字架！」——彼拉多突然向盧修斯做了個手勢，盧修斯迅速走近。

\

The Roman governor had sincerely hoped to thwart Caiaphas this time, for the sake of his wife -- and justice -- but he knew when he was beaten. This frenzied mob was on the verge of rioting.

為了他的妻子——和正義——羅馬總督真誠地希望這次挫敗該亞法，但他知道自己什麼時候被打敗了。 這群瘋狂的暴徒正處於暴亂的邊緣。



\

He spoke curtly.

他說話尖刻。

\

"Bring water." 

「帶水來。」

\

Pilate was furious -- with himself, with Caiaphas, and with the irrational mob of Jews, who were compelling him to accede to a monstrous injustice.

彼拉多很生氣——對自己、該亞法和非理性的猶太人暴徒，他們迫使他加入一個可怕的不公正。

Seeing the governor's servant approaching with a basin of water, Caiaphas raised his hands for silence, not wanting *any* of the Jews -- friend *or* foe -- to miss his victory over Rome -- *and* over the false "messiah."

看到總督的僕人拿著一盆水走過來，該亞法舉手要求保持沉默，不希望任何猶太人——朋友或敵人——錯過他對羅馬和假「彌賽亞」的勝利。

\

The mob fell silent as Pilate washed his hands ceremoniously, then dried them on the proffered towel.

當彼拉多認真洗手，然後用遞上的毛巾擦乾雙手時，暴徒們沉默了。

\

After a pause, Pilate spoke sternly -- even ferociously:

停頓了一下後，彼拉多嚴厲地說話——甚至兇猛地說：

\

"I am *innocent* of the blood of this righteous Man. This is on *you!"*

「我對這個正義的人的鮮血是無辜的。 都是你們的錯！」

\

"His blood be on *us* -- and on our *children!"* came the equally ferocious response from the mob.

「他的血在我們身上——還有我們的孩子身上！」 暴徒也做出了同樣兇猛的回應。

\

With a grim face and a heavy heart, Pilate turned to the centurion in charge of executions:

彼拉多面容嚴峻，心沉重，轉向負責處決的百夫長：

\

"Crucify Him."

「把他釘在十字架上。」

\

Then he turned, and strode away.

然後他轉過身來，大步走開了。
