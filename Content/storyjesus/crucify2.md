John's eyes widened with horror as His beloved Lord -- beaten, bloody, and bruised -- was brought out a second time from the Roman governor's judgement hall.

當他心愛的主——被毆打、流血和瘀傷——第二次從羅馬總督的審判大廳被帶出來時，約翰的眼睛驚恐地睜大了眼睛。

\

Beside him, Jesus' mother Mary shuddered and covered her face; without thinking, John put his arm around her protectively. 

在他身邊，耶穌的母親瑪麗顫抖著，遮住了她的臉；約翰不假思索地用一隻手臂保護性地摟住了她。

\

Mary Magdalene stood beside her, speechless and gaping, a river of tears streaming from her eyes, as she saw her Master, Jesus -- the kindest and most compassionate man she had ever met -- struggling to walk, with cruel, sharp thorns shaped into the mockery of a crown forced down upon His head. 

抹大拉的瑪麗站在她身邊，無言以對，目瞪口呆，眼淚從她的眼睛裡流了出來，她看到她的主人耶穌——她見過的最善良、最有同情心的男人——掙扎著走路，殘酷而尖銳的荊棘被塑造成一頂嘲諷的王冠，強行戴在了他的頭上。

\

His eyes met hers for just a moment, and she knew in a flash that He endured these atrocities deliberately and without regret -- for her, and for all humanity. 

他的目光與她相遇了片刻，她瞬間就知道，他故意忍受了這些暴行，沒有遺憾——為了她和全人類。

The crowd of Jews was silent for a moment as they took in the pitiable sight of the man many had hoped might be the God-sent military Messiah who would free them from Rome's iron grasp.

當猶太人看到這個貧窮的人時，他們沉默了一會兒。許多人先前曾希望這個人可能是上帝派來的軍事救世主，將他們從羅馬的鐵腕下解放出來。

\

Then, "Crucify! *Crucify!"* rang out from every quarter, with greater ferocity than before.

然後，｢釘在十字架上！ 釘在十字架上！」從每個季度都響起，比以前更兇猛。

After trying in vain to quiet the crowd, Pilate turned to Caiaphas.

彼拉多試圖讓人群安靜下來，但沒有成功，所以他轉向該亞法。

\

"Take Him yourselves and crucify Him, for I find no cause of execution in Him!" he said fiercely.

「你們自己把他帶走，把他釘在十字架上，因為我在他身上找不到處決的理由！」他兇狠地說。

\

Caiaphas stood and raised his hands, and the entire mob grew quickly silent.

該亞法站起來舉起了手，整個人群很快就沉默了。

\

He spoke distinctly, for all the mob to hear. "We have a law, and according to our law He must die, for He called Himself the *Son of God!"*

他說得很清楚，讓所有人都能聽到。 「我們有法律，根據我們的法律，他必須死，因為他稱自己為神的子！」

\

Son of *God?!*

神的子？！

\

Pilate turned on his heel and re-entered the judgement hall. 

彼拉多猛地轉身，重新進入審判廳。
