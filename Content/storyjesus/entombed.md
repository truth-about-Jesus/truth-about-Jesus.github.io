John's eyes widened.

約翰的眼睛睜大了。

\

"They're taking down His body."

「他們正在把他的屍體從十字架上放下來。」

\

Jesus' mother, Mary, and Mary Magdalene got up as quickly as they could. Although exhausted from the grief and horror of the day, they were determined to find out where Jesus' body would be buried.

耶穌的母親瑪麗和抹大拉的馬利亞以最快的速度起床了。 儘管從當天的悲傷和恐怖中精疲力盡，他們還是決心找出耶穌的屍體將被埋葬在哪裡。

\

It was getting late. Evening, marking the beginning of the Sabbath rest, was fast approaching.

已經很晚了。 傍晚，標誌著安息日休息的開始，很快就要到了。

\

After the Sabbath, they would return and anoint His body with aromatic spices and ointments, as was their custom.

安息日過後，他們會回來，用芳香的香料和軟膏塗抹他的身體，這是他們的習俗。

\

It was the last way they could care for their beloved Lord. 

這是他們關懷敬愛的主的最後方式。

Joseph of Arimathea led his servants, bearing the precious body now wrapped in fine linen, to a garden not far from Golgotha. 

亞利馬太的約瑟帶領僕人抬著用細亞麻布包裹的珍貴屍體，來到離各各他不遠的一個花園。

\

As they carefully laid Jesus' body in Joseph's own, newly constructed, unused tomb -- a cave hewn out of solid rock -- the rich man remembered how fervently he had hoped the miracle-working Teacher from Nazareth would turn out to be God's chosen Messiah.

他們小心翼翼地將耶穌的遺體安放在約瑟自己新建的、未使用的墳墓中——一個從堅硬的岩石中鑿出的洞穴。同時，富人回想起自己曾經多麼熱切地希望這位來自拿撒勒的行神蹟的教師是上帝選定的彌賽亞。

\

To his shame, he had hesitated to acknowledge this hope to his colleagues on the Jewish ruling council, especially once they'd hardened their hearts against the young Galilean. 

令他感到羞愧的是，他不敢向猶太統治理事會的同事承認這個希望，特別是在他們決定對這個年輕的加利利人冷酷無情之後。

\

But seeing how bravely, humbly, patiently -- even peacefully! -- Jesus had died... 

但看見耶穌如此勇敢、謙卑、有耐心──甚至平靜！──就在他快要死去的時候…

\

had infused Joseph with newfound faith -- much more than the preceding darkness and subsequent earthquake ever could have. 

為約瑟夫注入了新的信仰。即使之前的黑暗和隨後的地震也無法為他帶來這樣的啟示。

\

Taking this fledgling faith in hand, he had gone trembling to the Roman governor to request Jesus' body, that he might give the courageous rabbi a fitting interment.

懷著新的信仰，他顫抖地去見羅馬總督，請求得到耶穌的屍體，以便這位勇敢的拉比能有一個合適的埋葬之地。

\

He had failed God's chosen Messiah this time, he thought sorrowfully, as he rolled a huge stone against the entrance of the sepulchre.

他悲傷地想，這次他辜負了上帝選擇的彌賽亞，當他把一塊大石頭滾到墳墓的入口處時。

\

He would not do so again. 

他不會再這樣做了。

\

After Joseph had gone, the Chief Priest, along with a Roman guard detail, arrived at the site where Jesus' body lay entombed. 

約瑟夫離開後，大祭司長和一名羅馬衛兵一起到達了耶穌屍體被埋葬的地方。

\

Caiaphas had procured permission from Pilate to secure the sepulchre, so that no one could steal the body of the false Messiah. 

該亞法從彼拉多那裡獲得了保護墳墓的許可，這樣就沒有人可以偷走假彌賽亞的屍體。

\

That deceiver had actually said something about rising from the dead after three days!

那個騙子實際上說過一些關於三天後從死裡復活的話！

\

The Chief Priest placed an official seal over the stone, and stationed the guard with strict instructions.

大祭司在石頭上貼上了官方印章，並按照嚴格的指示駐紮了警衛。

\

After surveying the entire scene carefully...

在仔細觀察了整個場景後......

\

he left, satisfied the charlatan's deception was finally at an end. 

他離開了，確信騙子的欺騙終於結束了。
