Caiaphas waited impatiently for Pilate to return. 

該亞法不耐煩地等待彼拉多回來。

\

He hoped against hope that Pilate would agree to execute the prisoner without any further persuasion; however -- if not, Caiaphas was prepared -- as he always was. 

他衷心希望彼拉多能夠同意處決這名囚犯，而無需進一步說服。然而，即使沒有，該亞法也一如既往地準備好了。

\

His agents -- wily men adept at manipulating a mob -- were planted at strategic positions throughout the large crowd of Jews, who had heard of Jesus' arrest and had gathered outside the Roman governor's palace to hear the verdict. 

他的特工——擅長操縱暴徒的聰明人——被安置在一大群猶太人的戰略位置，他們聽說耶穌被捕，並聚集在羅馬總督府外聽判決。

\

Caiaphas knew and expected that many among the crowd were Jesus' followers from rural Galilee. 

該亞法知道並期望人群中的許多人是來自加利利農村的耶穌的追隨者。

\

He also knew that many Jews from the city -- Jerusalem -- were as yet undecided about the young rabbi from Nazareth. 

他還知道，許多來自耶路撒冷城的猶太人對來自拿撒勒的年輕拉比尚未決定。

\

It was his job, as Chief Priest, to safeguard the people -- and his nation -- from the threat of conflict with the superior power of Rome -- and give them peaceful lives. 

作為大祭司，他的工作是保護人民——和他的國家——免受與羅馬優越勢力衝突的威脅——並給他們和平的生活。

\

Jesus posed an unmistakable threat to this objective. 

耶穌對這個目標構成了明確無誤的威脅。

\

The Jews from Jerusalem would understand this. 

來自耶路撒冷的猶太人會理解這一點。

At last, Pilate emerged and headed toward the judgement seat. 

最後，彼拉多出現了，向審判席走去。

\

Again he took his time settling in as Caiaphas looked on tensely, anticipating his next move.

他再次花時間安頓下來，該亞法斯緊張地看著，期待著他的下一步行動。

\

At last, Pilate looked at him, with an impassive expression on his face.

最後，彼拉多看著他，臉上帶著無表情。

\

"I find no fault in Him."

「我發現他是無罪的。」

"And --" Pilate continued, as Caiaphas opened his mouth to respond, "there is the custom that i release to you one prisoner at Passover."

該亞法還來不及回答，彼拉多就繼續說道：「按照慣例，我會在逾越節釋放一個囚犯給你們。」

\

He paused.

他停頓了一下。

\

Caiaphas gaped. In all the planning and busyness, he had forgotten about the Passover prisoner release!

該亞法目瞪口呆。 在所有的計劃和忙碌中，他忘記了逾越節囚犯的釋放！

\

He sensed the opportunity to be finally rid of the troublesome young Galilean -- slipping from his grasp.

他感覺到了一個機會，可以最終擺脫那個造成如此多麻煩的年輕加利利人——從他的掌握中溜走。

\

The only other Hebrew prisoner Pilate held who could be released was Barabbas, a violent rebel who had murdered a Roman soldier in the recent uprising.

除了耶穌之外，唯一能夠被彼拉多釋放的希伯來人是巴拉巴，他是一名暴力叛亂者，在最近的一次起義中謀殺了一名羅馬士兵。

\

Caiaphas knew releasing such a man would be completely against his primary objective of preserving peace with Rome, but he felt he had no choice. 

該亞法知道釋放這樣一個人並不能推進他與羅馬維持和平的首要目​​標，但他覺得自己別無選擇。

\

Jesus was a much greater threat.

耶穌是一個更大的威脅。

\

He signalled Malchus, his most trusted servant, and whispered urgently in his ear. 

他向他最信任的僕人馬爾丘斯示意，並在他耳邊急切地低聲說。
