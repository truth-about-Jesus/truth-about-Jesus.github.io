Meanwhile, Jesus' guard detail had gathered together the other soldiers under Pilate's command to "have a little fun" with the so-called "king of the Jews" -- and hopefully blow off some steam.

與此同時，耶穌的警衛人員召集了彼拉多指揮下的其他士兵，與所謂的「猶太人之王」「玩得開心」——並希望能夠發洩一下。

\

Military service in this barbaric land was replete with stresses and frustrations, after all. 

畢竟，在這片蒙昧的土地上服兵役充滿了壓力和挫折感。

\

One of the more enterprising and creative of the soldiers had *actually* taken young branches from a thorn tree and woven them together to form a fitting "crown" for this pretender to Rome's sovereignty in the region.

一名更有進取心和創造力的士兵實際上從荊棘樹上取下樹枝並將它們編織在一起，為挑戰羅馬在該地區主權的覬覦者製作了一頂合適的「王冠」。

\

It would be a shame to let it go to waste.

讓它浪費掉太可惜了。

\

Deep, painful, still bleeding lacerations covered Jesus' back, legs -- and even the soles of His feet. 

深深的、痛苦的、仍在流血的撕裂傷覆蓋了耶穌的背部、腿——甚至他的腳底。

\

He was unsteady from blood loss and could hardly stand.

他因失血而不穩定，幾乎無法站立。

\

Still, His guard detail half-dragged, half-carried Him into the judgement hall where the entire cohort of Roman soldiers had gathered. 

儘管如此，他的衛兵半拖半抬地把他帶進了審判廳，那裡聚集了一整支羅馬士兵。

\

One of them positioned a "crown" bristling with long, sharp thorns on Jesus' head, being careful not to pierce his own hands.

他們中的一個人在耶穌的頭上放了一個長長而鋒利的刺的「王冠」，小心翼翼地不要刺穿自己的手。

\

Two others removed His bloodstained clothes and enrobed Him in a crimson military cloak.

另外兩個人把他沾滿血跡的衣服脫下來，給他穿上了一件深紅色的軍斗篷。

\

Finally, a stiff reed was placed in His hand, to serve as a "royal sceptre."

最後，一根堅硬的蘆葦被放在他的手中，作為「皇家權杖」。

\

Terrible, fiery pain urged Him to slip into unconsciousness, but Jesus forced Himself to sit where His guard detail had placed Him, as the soldiers, each in turn, knelt before Him in mock deference, loudly proclaiming, "Hail, King of the Jews!"

可怕的、火熱的疼痛使他想要陷入昏迷，但耶穌強迫自己坐在警衛隊安排他的地方，而士兵們則依次跪在他面前，假裝敬意，大聲喊道：「萬歲，猶太人的王！」

\
\

Each soldier, as he rose from his kneeling position, then made some gesture of contempt to impress his fellows.

每個士兵，當他從跪著的姿勢中站起來時，都做出了一些蔑視的手勢來打動他的同伴。

\

The first merely spit in Jesus' face, thereby drawing raucous howls of laughter from his compatriots.

第一個只是向耶穌的臉上吐口水，從而引來他的同伴們發出嚎叫的笑聲。

\

The next grabbed the reed out of Jesus' hand and rapped Him smartly on the head with it, causing the thorns on the crown to pierce His scalp. 

下一個從耶穌手中抓起蘆葦，用蘆葦巧妙地拍打他的頭，導致冠上的刺刺穿了他的頭皮。

\

The soldiers' hilarity knew no bounds. 

士兵們的搞笑是無限的。

Jesus sat quietly, not fighting back or resisting, but allowing Himself to fully experience the abuse... *not* because He thought He deserved it --

耶穌靜靜地坐著，沒有反擊或反抗，而是讓自己充分體驗虐待......不是因為他認為自己活該——

\

He knew He did not --

他知道他不該受到如此惡劣的對待——

\

and *certainly* not because He enjoyed it --

當然不是因為他喜歡它——

\

in addition to the physical pain, He found it deeply hurtful to be so completely dishonoured and rejected by these tiny precious creatures which He Himself had carefully designed and created, and was even now sustaining with life and breath --

除了肉體上的痛苦，他內心也受到了深深的傷害，他發現自己被這些他精心設計和創造的微小而珍貴的生物徹底羞辱和拒絕。即使現在他仍用生命和呼吸維持他們——

\

all of whom He could easily, instantly, with just one word or minuscule gesture, decimate to atoms at any time... if He so chose...

他可以輕鬆地，即時地，只需一個字或微小的手勢，隨時將所有人全部粉碎成原子......如果他選擇的話......

\

\
\

No. Jesus endured and embraced this abject humiliation simply because...

不。 耶穌忍受並接受了這種卑劣的屈辱，僅僅是因為......

\

He cherished, with His Father, an ocean of love.

他和他的父親一起珍視著愛的海洋。
