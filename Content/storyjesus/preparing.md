Judas Iscariot had only one thought in his mind. 

加略人猶大腦海中只有一個想法。

\

*Revenge.*

復仇。

\

Well, actually -- two thoughts: he also wanted to make back the money that was lost in the fiasco in which Jesus had actually approved of that ridiculous girl wasting all that costly perfume -- his own portion of it, at least. 

好吧，實際上- 有兩個想法：他還想賺回他在慘敗中損失的錢，耶穌實際上批准了那個可笑的女孩浪費了所有昂貴的香水- 至少他想拿回他應得的部分。

\

He was one of Jesus' chosen Apostles. And the moneybag belonged to all of them. 

他是耶穌拣選的使徒之一。 錢袋屬於他們所有人。

\

Therefore, at least one-thirteenth of what was in there belonged to him personally -- to do with as he pleased, he thought.

所以，這十三部分至少有一份是他自己的──他想，他可以隨心所欲地使用它。

\

He'd heard the Chief Priests would pay handsomely for information to help them arrest Jesus. 

他聽說大祭司會花大筆錢來獲取資訊，幫助他們逮捕耶穌。

\

This would be the perfect opportunity to punish Jesus for His foolish wastefulness and recover some of Judas' lost "income", as he fondly liked to think of it. 

這將是懲罰耶穌愚蠢的浪費，並收回猶大失去的一些「收入」的絕佳機會，因為他喜歡這樣想。

Meanwhile, Peter and John, two others of Jesus' chosen Apostles, approached Jesus where they were staying, just outside the city of Jerusalem.

同時，耶穌所揀選的另外兩位使徒彼得和約翰在耶路撒冷郊外來到耶穌那裡，他們都在那裡作客。

\

"Master, where shall we make preparations for You to eat the Passover?"

「夫子，我們到哪裡去為您準備逾越節的筵席呢？」

\

The Passover was, and still is, the most important feast given to the Jews by God to celebrate His rescuing them miraculously from four hundred years of harsh slavery in Egypt. As Jews themselves, Jesus and His chosen Apostles observed the Passover celebration faithfully in Jerusalem every year. 

逾越節過去是，現在仍然是上帝賜予猶太人的最重要的節日，以慶祝他奇蹟般地將他們從埃及四百年的殘酷奴隸制中拯救出來。 作為猶太人自己，耶穌和他拣選的使徒每年都在耶路撒冷忠實地慶祝逾越節慶祝活動。

\

Jesus listened to what His Father was saying to Him, then responded kindly. 

耶穌聽了他父親對他說的話，然後親切地迴應。

\

"Go into the city, and there a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you."

「進城去吧，那裡有一個男僕提著一壺水來迎接你們。」

\

Peter and John started with surprise -- a man doing women's work?!

彼得和約翰很驚訝──一個男人做女人的工作？ ！

\

"Follow him, and wherever he goes in, say to the master of the house: 'The Teacher says, "Where is the guest-room, where I and my disciples may eat the Passover together?"' He will show you a large upper room, furnished and ready -- make preparations for us there."

「跟著他，無論他進入哪一間房子，就對房子的主人說：『老師說：『客房在哪裡，我和我的門徒可以在那裡一起吃逾越節的晚餐？』他會帶你們去看一間寬敞的樓上房間，家具齊全，準備就緒——在那裡為我們做好準備。」

\

It turned out, of course, exactly as Jesus had said. 

當然，結果正如耶穌所說的那樣。

\

After all of their experiences following Jesus for the past three years, Peter and John were not terribly surprised about it.

在經歷了過去三年跟隨耶穌的所有經歷之後，彼得和約翰對此並不感到非常驚訝。

\
\

The Chief Priests were overjoyed to discover that one of Jesus' personally handpicked Apostles was willing to be their inside man. 

祭司長們欣喜若狂地發現耶穌親自挑選的一位使徒願意成為他們的內部人。

\

They did not skimp on the payment, as the troublesome young teacher and healer had embarrassed them more than once and risked bringing powerful Rome down on the entire nation -- not to mention having broken the Sabbath while brazenly defending His sinful actions -- and thumbing His nose at the traditions of the elders. So bringing Him down was a top priority. 

他們在薪水上並沒有吝嗇，因為這位麻煩的年輕老師和治療師已經不只一次讓他們難堪了。 他冒著讓強大的羅馬暴力鎮壓整個國家的風險——更不用說為了公然為自己的罪惡行為辯護而違反安息日了——而且他對長輩的傳統嗤之以鼻。 所以擊敗他是當務之急。

\

"Thirty silver coins?"

「三十枚銀幣？」

\

Judas gaped. 

猶大目瞪口呆。

\

"Yes!" he answered quickly, before they could change their minds. 

「是的！」 在他們改變主意之前，他很快就回答了。

\

"Make sure it is done secretly. We don't want the people to riot."

「確保它是秘密完成的。 我們不希望人們騷亂。」

\

They threw him the bag of Tyrian shekels. It was blood money for a traitor, and they didn't want to chance becoming unclean before the holy Passover celebration. 

他們把一袋提爾謝克爾丟給他。 這是對叛徒的報酬。 他們不想在神聖的逾越節慶祝活動之前冒著變得不潔的風險。

\

The traitor Apostle nodded, covered his face, and left as silently as he had come, clutching his precious prize, his heart filled with a sense of evil satisfaction...

叛徒使徒點了點頭，他摀住臉，像他來時一樣默默地離開了，抓著他珍貴的獎品，他的心裡充滿了邪惡的滿足感......
