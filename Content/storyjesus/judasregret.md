Judas Iscariot was shocked.

加略人猶大感到震驚。

\

He had been with those awaiting the outcome of Jesus' trial -- secretly anticipating His miraculous escape -- when he'd heard the uproar of the Council condemning Jesus to death. 

當他聽到理事會判處耶穌死刑的喧囂聲時，他一直和那些等待耶穌審判結果的人在一起——偷偷地期待著他的奇蹟般的逃跑。

\

At that moment the first twinges of regret began to filter through the wall of self-justification that protected his conscience.

在那一刻，第一滴悔恨開始透過保護他良心的自我辯解之牆滲透進來。

\

Then, when the Temple guards were leading out the prisoner -- his kindhearted and gentle former Lord and Master -- Judas saw blood, fresh bruising and spittle on His face.

然後，當聖殿衛兵帶領囚犯出去時——他心地善良溫柔的前主人——猶大看到他臉上有血、新鮮的瘀傷和唾沫。

\

This had never happened before. Jesus had never allowed Himself to be taken -- let alone struck -- by anyone. 

這以前從未發生過。 耶穌從未允許自己被任何人帶走——更不用說被打了。

\

The trickle of regret grew into a stream.

涓涓涓涓的遺憾變成了一股溪流。

\

When Judas found out Jesus was to be handed over to the Romans to suffer public crucifixion -- the worst possible death of prolonged torture and humiliation --

當猶大發現耶穌將被移交給羅馬人公開釘十字架時——長期的酷刑和羞辱是最嚴重的死亡——

\

the stream surged into a raging river.

小溪變成了洶湧的河流。

\

His unprotected conscience now flooded with the realization of the evil and injustice he had set in motion, Judas Iscariot rushed up the stone steps to the chamber where the Sanhedrin had so recently sat.

他毫無保護的良心現在充滿了對他所引發的邪惡和不公正的認識，加略人猶大衝上石階，來到公會最近坐過的房間。

\

Caiaphas was preparing triumphantly to leave, to accompany the condemned prisoner on His final trip to the Roman governor to have His execution confirmed. 

該亞法正準備勝利地離開，陪同被判刑的囚犯最後一次前往羅馬總督那裡，以確認他的處決。

\

At first the Temple guards barred Judas' way, but Caiaphas recognized him and signalled them to permit his approach. 

起初，聖殿的守衛們禁止猶大前進，但該亞法認出了他，並示意他們允許他接近。

\

Before Caiaphas could utter a word, Judas hurled the now hated bag of Tyrian shekels at his feet. 

該亞法還沒來得及說一句話，猶大就把現在令人討厭的提利安謝克爾袋扔到他的腳下。

\

*"I have sinned!"* he cried, his face contorted with uncontrollable guilt. 

「我犯罪了！」 他哭了，臉上扭曲著無法控制的內疚。

\

*"I have betrayed innocent blood!"*

「我背叛了無辜的鮮血！」

\
\

Affronted, Caiaphas hardened his heart against the distraught former Apostle. 

該亞法被冒犯，對這位心煩意亂的前使徒硬了。

\

This foolish young man had served his purpose. And Caiaphas was in a rush to finalize the prisoner's execution at the governor's palace before evening, which would mark the beginning of the holy Passover Sabbath. 

這個愚蠢的年輕人已經達到了他的目的。 該亞法急於傍晚前在總督宮完成對囚犯的處決，這將標誌著神聖的逾越節安息日的開始。

\

"What is that to us?" he scowled impatiently. 

「那對我們來說是什麼？」 他不耐煩地皺著眉頭。

\

"See to it yourself!"

「你自己處理吧！」

\
\

It was time. 

是時候了。

\

Time for justice -- for an intolerable evil to be made right. 

是時候伸張正義了——讓不可容忍的邪惡得到糾正。

\

Judas Iscariot knew he could not live with the guilt and unrelenting torment of what he had done. 

加略人猶大知道他無法忍受自己的所作所為所帶來的愧疚和無情的折磨。

\

Later, after Judas' body was discovered, the little bag of Tyrian shekels he had so intensely desired was used to buy a potter's field... 

後來，在猶大的屍體被發現後，他非常渴望的一小袋泰利安謝克爾被用來買一個陶工的田地......

\

as a burial place for foreigners...

作為外國人的埋葬地......

\

the "Field of Blood."

「血場」。
