At last, it was *his* turn. 

終於輪到他了。

\

Ananias stepped forward and laid the shekels -- 

阿納尼亞斯走上前去，放下了錢——

\

*half of what he had received from selling a field to his foolish neighbour! --* 

那隻是他把田地賣給愚蠢鄰居所得金額的一半！--

\

at the Apostle Peter's feet. 

在使徒彼得的腳下。

\

"We sold a field, and offer the *full proceeds* to support the needy among the Messiah's followers," he said, 

他說，「我們賣掉了一片田地，現在，我們將全部收益捐給您，用於幫助彌賽亞信徒中的貧困者。」

\

as Joe Barnabas had done.

正如喬·巴納巴斯所做的那樣。

\

*That* ought to buy him a little favour and influence with the leaders of the Messiah's movement!

這應該讓他在彌賽亞運動的主管人中獲得一點恩惠和影響力！

\
\

The Holy Spirit bristled, filling Peter with honest indignation,

聖靈怒髮衝冠，讓彼得充滿了真誠的憤慨，

\

then spoke gently through him.

然後透過他悄然說話。

\

"Ananias, how has Satan so filled your heart 

「阿納尼亞斯，撒旦是如何填滿你的心的

\

to *lie* to the Holy Spirit, 

對聖靈撒謊，

\

and conceal a portion 

並隱藏一部分

\

of the proceeds of the sale?"

銷售收益？」

\

The *amount* was not the question, 

金額不是問題，

\

as Peter well knew

正如彼得所熟知的那樣 

\

from his Master's teaching on giving.

源自於他師父關於給予錢的教導。

\

But the *lie* 

但是謊言

\

was a problem.

是個問題。

\

<center>💠</center>

\
\

"Wasn't the field yours

「田地不是你的嗎

\

before it was sold? 

在它被賣掉之前？

\

And once sold, the money received was *still* yours -- to do with as you pleased.

一旦售出，收到的錢仍然是你的——隨心所欲。

\

How could you think to *do* such a thing? 

你怎麼會想到做這種事？

\

You haven't lied to *men,* 

你沒有對男人撒謊，

\

but to *God!"*

但卻對上帝說謊！」

\

As soon as the words were out of Peter's mouth,

彼得一說出這些話，

\

Ananias 

阿納尼亞斯

\

collapsed.

摔倒了。

\

\

*Based on Acts 4:32-37; Acts 5:1-11; Mark 12:41-44.*

基於使徒行傳4:32-37；使徒行傳5:1-11；馬可福音12:41-44。
