*"Open up in there!"*

「打開這扇門！」

\

Someone was pounding at the door.

有人在猛烈地敲門。

\

John got up sleepily and, without thinking, opened the door

約翰昏昏欲睡地起床，不假思索地開啟了門

\

to a sudden, chaotic invasion of torches, leather, weapons --

火炬、皮革、武器的突然、混亂的入侵——

\

and rough treatment. 

和動粗。

\

When the dust had settled, all of Jesus' chosen Apostles were in jail --

\

with armed guards standing before doors

\

firmly bolted from the outside.

\
\

Caiaphas took his time calling together the Ruling Council. 

該亞法並沒有急於統召集治理事會議。

\

There was no rush, now that the main followers of the false Messiah were safely ensconced away from their adoring -- *he grimaced* -- public. 

既然假彌賽亞的主要追隨者已被安全地監禁起來，遠離了崇拜他們的公眾——他做了個鬼臉——那就不用著急了。

\

*Let them stew in jail!*

讓他們待在監獄裡！

\

The Council would be convened when he was good and ready. 

理事會將在他準備好並準備好時召開。

\

\
\

John ate a little of the bread the two Marys had brought to the jail.

約翰吃了一點兩位馬利亞帶到監獄的麵包。

\

Although he could fast, he appreciated their loving gesture to support the Apostles during their imprisonment.

雖然他可以禁食，但他很欣賞他們在使徒被監禁期間支援他們的慈愛姿態。

\

He'd overheard the latest guards saying the Council was to be convened in the morning.

他無意中聽到新來的衛兵說，事會將於明天早上召開。

\

The circumstances of their imprisonment had not been pleasant, 

他們被監禁的情況並不愉快，

\

but he trusted the Holy Spirit would give them *yet another opportunity* 

但他相信聖靈會再給他們一次機會

\

to testify boldly to Jesus' resurrection.

大膽地見證耶穌的復活。

\

\
\

The cell door creaked open.

牢房的門吱呀一聲開了。

\

John sat up drowsily. 

約翰昏昏欲睡地坐了起來。

\

It was still dark... *not time for their hearing yet...?*

天還黑......現在就進行審判還為時過早......？

\

A bright light entered the cell, and the Apostles shielded sleep-infused eyes.

明亮的光線進入牢房，使徒們遮蔽了充滿睡眠的眼睛。

\

"Hurry, get up!" commanded the luminous being.

「快點，起來！」 指揮發光的存在。

\

Confused yet obedient, many imagining they were merely dreaming, 

困惑但聽話，許多人想象他們只是在做夢，

\

they followed the angel out the door,

他們跟著天使出了門，

\

around the guards --

在警衛周圍——

\

*who didn't seem to notice them! --*

誰似乎沒有注意到他們！--

\

and outside into the street.

然後走到外面，到街上去。

\

*"Go,"* said the angel to them all.

\

"Stand in the Temple, and speak to the people 

「站在聖殿裡，向人們講話

\

all these words of *life."*
