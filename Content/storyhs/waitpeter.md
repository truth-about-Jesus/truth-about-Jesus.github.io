As he waited with the others to be "clothed with power from on high," as Jesus had put it, Peter reminisced.

彼得和其他人一起等候耶穌吩咐他們的「從上頭來的能力」。他一邊等候，一邊回憶往事。

\

The day Jesus had been arrested had been the worst failure of his entire life. He'd gone from insisting he was ready to die for his Master -- to pretending he didn't even know Him...

耶穌被捕的那一天是他一生中最糟糕的失敗。 他從堅持說他準備為他的主人而死——到假裝他甚至不認識他......

\

*three times!*

三次！

\

It had destroyed Peter inside to see His beloved Lord ridiculed, tortured, humiliated and crucified.

它摧毀了彼得的內心，看到他心愛的主被嘲笑、折磨、羞辱和被釘在十字架上。

\

Knowing he'd utterly failed to stand up for His Master... as he'd promised... had made him feel much worse... if that were even possible...

知道他完全沒有為他的主人挺身而出......正如他承諾的那樣......這讓他感覺更糟......如果這有可能的話......

\

Like an open wound that could never heal.

就像一個永遠無法癒合的開放性傷口。

\

\
\

After Jesus had risen from death, Peter had been joyful, of course...

當然，耶穌從死裡復活後，彼得一直很快樂......

\

Who wouldn't be?

誰不會呢？

\

But things *couldn't* be the same.

但彼得與耶穌的關係已經不再像以前了。

\

Peter knew he had failed to live up to his bravado...

彼得知道他沒能不辜負他的勇敢......

\

so where did that leave them... 

那麼，那把他們留在哪裡了......

\

him... and Jesus?

他......還有耶穌？

\

He knew he didn't deserve to be Jesus' disciple anymore... let alone one of His chosen Apostles. 

他知道自己不配再做耶穌的門徒了......更不用說他所揀選的使徒之一了。

\

Yet, for some reason, he couldn't walk away... 

然而，出於某種原因，他無法走開......

\

or move on.

或者去做別的事。

\

\
\

Then, on one occasion when Jesus had appeared to His followers alive after death -- before He was taken up to Heaven, of course --

然後，有一次，當耶穌死後活著向他的追隨者顯現時——當然，在他被帶到天堂之前——

\

the hungry Apostles had been fishing fruitlessly all night. 

飢餓的使徒們整晚都在釣魚，沒有結果。

\

Jesus, standing on shore, had arranged a huge catch of fish! -- 

耶穌站在岸邊，安排他們捕捉—大量的魚！—

\

*Just like old times!* Peter mused --

就像過去一樣！ 彼得沉思著——

\

and thoughtfully prepared breakfast for them.

並貼心地為他們準備了早餐。

\

<center>💠</center>

\
\

After breakfast, they'd gone for a walk -- just Peter and Jesus. 

早餐後，他們去散步了——只有彼得和耶穌。

\

Jesus had asked him, three times, 

耶穌問了他三次，

\

"Do you love Me?" 

「你愛我嗎？」

\

Each time, Peter had answered honestly, although with shame, "Yes, Lord. You know that i love You."

每次，彼得都誠實地回答，儘管帶著羞愧，「是的，主啊。 你知道我愛你。」

\

And each time, Jesus had commanded him, "Feed my sheep."

每次，耶穌都命令他：「牧養我的羊。」

\

Or lambs.

或者羔羊。

\

By the third repetition Peter was feeling disconsolate --

第三次重複，彼得感到沮喪——

\

but in the end he came to understand that Jesus was *undoing,* together with him, the three times he had claimed not to know His Lord.

但最終，他明白了，耶穌正在和他一起推翻他不認識他的主的三次說法。

\

Jesus was giving him a fresh start... a second chance.

耶穌給了他一個新的開始......第二次機會。

\

And Peter's heart was grateful... 

彼得的心很感激......

\

and glad.

並且快樂的。
