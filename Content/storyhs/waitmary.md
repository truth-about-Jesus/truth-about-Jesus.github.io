Mary, Jesus' mother, sat waiting and praying with the rest of her Son's followers.

Whenever there was a practical need, she or one of the other women gladly took care of it.

When Jesus had led them all up to the top of a high mountain, His mother had already had an inkling of what was about to happen.

當耶穌帶領他們所有人登上一座高山時，他的母親已經預感到即將發生的事情。

\

Her Son had always been loving and attentive toward her, but that morning He'd been especially kind... 

她的兒子一直對她充滿愛和關心，但那天早上他特別善良......

\

sad... yet joyful, at the same time.

\

His warm embrace, before leading them all out, had told Mary all she needed to know...

While waiting with the others for the Holy Spirit to come, Mary thought about the first angel she had ever met, puzzling over his message.

在和其他人一起等待聖靈降臨時，瑪麗想到了她遇到的第一個天使，嘗試理解他的訊息。

\

Gabriel had come from God to tell her about the Son which she, a virgin, would miraculously conceive:

加百列從上帝那裡來，告訴她一個奇蹟，她將會生下一個兒子，儘管她還是處女：

\

"He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give Him the throne of His father, David. He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and His kingdom will never end.”

「他將是偉大的，將被稱為至高者的兒子。 主上帝將把他父親大衛的王位賜給他。 他將永遠統治雅各家，他的王國永遠不會結束。」

\

The angelic prophecy hadn't been fulfilled yet... 

天使預言還沒有實現......

\

and Mary honestly didn't see how it ever *could* be, now...

老實說，瑪麗不知道這怎麼可能，現在......

\

But deep down, in her heart of hearts, Mary nursed a growing, childlike faith that, someday,  somehow, she would see

但在內心深處，瑪麗懷著一種不斷增長的、孩子般的信仰，總有一天，不知何故，她會看到

\

Jesus 

耶穌

\

on the throne,

\

with her own eyes.
