James sat waiting and praying with the other Apostles. 

The past three years had been the most eventful -- heart-rending -- and joyous! -- of his entire life.

It was a relief now to have this time to be silent, meditate and pray, as they waited for the Master's promise to be fulfilled.

The day Jesus had gone back to Heaven, James had been expecting He would free Israel from the Roman oppressors. He knew many -- if not all! -- of the other Apostles had felt the same.

So when Jesus had commanded them to remain in Jerusalem until they were "clothed with power from on high," he'd imagined it was so they might establish Jesus as the nation's king.

Although... James reflected now... 

Most of the Master's teachings were about being "poor in spirit"... gentle... kind... like a child... a servant... loving their enemies... 

He didn't quite see how it all fit together.

ðŸ’ 

He hadn't been the least bit surprised when one of the other Apostles -- probably Peter! -- had asked Jesus bluntly:

"Lord, is it time now for You to restore the kingdom to Israel?"

It was what James himself had been wondering, ever since Jesus had come back to life.

ðŸ’ 

But...

he had been completely taken by surprise when Jesus' feet had left the earth and He'd started floating higher and higher, up into the sky.

Where was their King going?!
