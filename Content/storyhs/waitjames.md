James sat waiting and praying with the other Apostles. 

詹姆斯和其他使徒們一起坐著等待和祈禱。

\

The past three years had been the most eventful -- heart-rending -- *and joyous!* -- of his entire life.

過去的三年是他整個一生中最多事的——令人心碎——和快樂！

\

It was a relief now to have this time to be silent, meditate and pray, as they waited for the Master's promise to be fulfilled.

現在有這個時間安靜、冥想和祈禱，當他們等待師父的承諾實現時，真是鬆了一口氣。

The day Jesus had gone back to Heaven, James had been expecting He would free Israel from the Roman oppressors. He knew many -- *if not all!* -- of the other Apostles had felt the same.

詹姆斯回想起耶穌升天的那一天。那一天，詹姆斯一直希望並期待耶穌能將以色列從羅馬壓迫者手中解放出來。 他知道許多——如果不是全部的話！——其他使徒也有同樣的感覺。

\

So when Jesus had commanded them to remain in Jerusalem until they were "clothed with power from on high," he'd imagined it was so they might establish Jesus as the nation's king.

因此，當耶穌命令他們留在耶路撒冷，直到他們「披上從上而來的權力」時，詹姆斯想像他們這樣做是為了加冕耶穌為國家的國王。

\

*Although...* James reflected now... 

雖然... 詹姆斯現在反思了......

\

Most of the Master's teachings were about being "poor in spirit"... gentle... kind... like a child... a servant... loving their enemies... 

大師的大部分教義是關於「精神貧乏」......溫柔......善良......像個孩子......一個僕人......愛他們的敵人......

\

He didn't quite see how it all fit together.

他不太明白這一切是如何結合在一起的。

\
\

He hadn't been the least bit surprised when one of the other Apostles -- *probably Peter!* -- had asked Jesus bluntly:

彼得很可能是直接向耶穌提出這個問題的使徒，而詹姆斯對此一點也不感到驚訝。

\

"Lord, is it time now for You to restore the kingdom to Israel?"

「主啊，現在是你恢復以色列王國的時候嗎？」

\

It was what James himself had been wondering, ever since Jesus had come back to life.

自從耶穌復活以來，詹姆斯自己一直想知道這一點。

\
\

But...

但是...

\

he *had* been *completely* taken by surprise when Jesus' feet had left the earth and He'd started floating higher and higher, up into the sky.

當耶穌的腳離開地面時，他完全驚呆了。然後耶穌開始在空中飄得越來越高。

\

*Where was their King going?!*

他們的國王要去哪裡？！
