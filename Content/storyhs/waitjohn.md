John thought back to that last Passover meal with Jesus, the night before His death. 

約翰回想起耶穌去世前一晚與耶穌一起吃的最後一頓逾越節大餐。

\

He'd said He was leaving to go back to the Father, and would send them someone else, who would stay with them forever --

他說他要離開回到父親那裡，然後會派別人給他們，這個人會永遠和他們在一起——

\

the Helper.

保惠師。

\

He'd called the Helper "the Holy Spirit" and "the Spirit of Truth"... who would come alongside His followers, clarifying sin, justice and judgement to the world... just as Jesus had done.

他稱保惠師為「聖靈」和「真理之靈」......他會來幫助耶穌的跟隨者，明確向世人澄清罪惡、公義和審判......就像耶穌所做的那樣。

\

After Jesus had risen miraculously from death, John had hoped Jesus would show Himself alive to those who had conspired against Him, as proof of His deity.

耶穌奇蹟般地從死裡復活後，約翰希望耶穌向那些密謀反對他的人顯現自己活著，以證明他的神性。

\

But He hadn't.

但他沒有這麼做。

\

Instead, He had spent forty days with His followers privately, teaching them more about the Kingdom of God.

相反，他私下裡和他的追隨者一起度過了四十天，教他們更多關於神的國度。

\

Then He'd been taken up to Heaven, and they hadn't seen Him since.

然後他被帶到了天堂，從那以後他們就沒見過他了。

\

That was eight days ago. 

那是八天前。

\

A *long* eight days...

漫長的八天......

\

Now the Apostles and disciples -- about 120 in all -- were gathered in Jerusalem, waiting, as Jesus had commanded.

現在，使徒和門徒——大約120人——按照耶穌的命令，聚集在耶路撒冷等待。

\

Just before leaving, He'd given them a task to do -- a daunting one, far beyond their own human capabilities:

就在離開之前，他給了他們一項任務——一項艱鉅的任務，遠遠超出了他們自己的人類能力：

\

To go into *all* the world and share the good news with *every* creature...

去全世界，傳福音給萬民聽......

\

To make disciples of *all* peoples!

培養所有民族的門徒！

\

It was mind-boggling. 

這令人壓倒。

\

John fervently hoped -- and *trusted* -- the Helper would come soon. 

約翰熱切地希望——並相信——保惠師會很快到來。
