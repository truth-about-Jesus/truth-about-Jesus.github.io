Thomas wasn't going *anywhere.*

托馬斯哪裡也不去。

\

He hadn't been here the first time -- and had missed out on seeing Jesus soon after He'd risen from the dead.

他第一次沒有來這裡，並且錯過了在耶穌復活後不久見到他的機會。

\

All the others had seen Him... except Thomas.

其他人都見過他......除了托馬斯。

\

And then he'd had to wait an extra *eight days* before Jesus came back again!

然後他不得不多等八天，耶穌才再次回來！

\

*Of course* he hadn't believed the others when they'd told him.

當然，當其他人告訴他時，他並沒有相信他們。

\

He'd *seen* His Lord cruelly crucified -- dead and buried -- with his own eyes.

他親眼看到他的主被殘忍地釘在十字架上——死了又被埋葬了。

\

There wasn't any doubt.

毫無疑問。

\

But Jesus --

但是耶穌——

\

hadn't seen things the same way.

從不同的角度看待事物。

\

When He'd come back -- eight days later -- He'd invited Thomas to do the things he needed, to believe:

八天后，當他回來時，他邀請托馬斯做他需要做的事情，以便相信：

\

put his finger in the nail holes in Jesus' hands, and place his hand in the spear hole in His side,

把他的手指放在耶穌手中的釘子孔裡，把手放在他側邊的長矛洞裡，

\

and He'd urged Thomas, "Do not be faithless, but believing."

他敦促托馬斯：「不要不信，總要信。」

\

Once convinced it really *was* His Lord, Thomas had responded with joyous worship!

一旦確信這真的是他的主，托馬斯就會以喜悅的敬拜來回應！

\

But then Jesus had said something very odd, Thomas thought. 

但隨後耶穌說了一些非常奇怪的話，托馬斯想。

\

What was it?

那是什麼？

\

"You believe because you've seen Me, Thomas. Blessed are those who have *not* seen --

「你相信，因為你見過我，托馬斯。 沒有見過我的人有福了——

\

and *still* believe."

並且仍然相信。」

\

\

Whatever Jesus had meant by that, Thomas knew one thing for sure:

不管耶穌的意思是什麼，托馬斯肯定知道一件事：

\

He was going to be *right* here, when the Holy Spirit came!

當聖靈降臨時，他就會在這裡！

\

He *wasn't* going to miss out *this* time. 

他這次不會錯過的。
