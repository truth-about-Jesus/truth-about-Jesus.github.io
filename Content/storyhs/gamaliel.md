Just as Nicodemus and Joseph began to despair for the lives of their Lord's Apostles...

who had remained seated while the others were expressing their outrage,

\

rose calmly from his place.

\

A hush began to fall over the Council Hall, 

理事會大廳開始陷入寂安靜，

\

as Gamaliel signalled the Temple guards to remove the Apostles from the room.

當迦瑪列向聖殿衛士發出訊號，他們把使徒們帶出房間。

began to resume their seats.

\

Gamaliel continued: 

迦瑪列繼續說道：

\

"We've dealt with false messiahs before: remember Theudas?

「我們以前處理過虛假的彌賽亞：還記得特烏達斯嗎？

\

He made great claims for himself, and about four hundred followed him. 

他對自己吹噓得非常厲害，進而大約有四百人跟隨他。

\

But when he was killed, all his followers were dispersed

\

and the movement came to nothing."

\

More sat now, remembering.

\

"And after him, Judas from Galilee rose to prominence, in the days of the head tax enrollment; *he* attracted *many* followers!"

「在他之後，來自加利利的猶大在頭稅登記的日子裡嶄露頭角；他吸引了許多追隨者！」

\

He looked around. 

他環顧四周。

\

"But when *he* died, all of *his* followers were scattered, too."

「但當他去世時，他所有的追隨者也散了。」

\

Heads nodded in sage agreement now, as nearly all were back in their seats.

\

Desist from these men, and leave them be.

\

For if this movement is from man,

\

it will come to an end and disappear."
