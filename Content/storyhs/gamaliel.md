Just as Nicodemus and Joseph began to despair for the lives of their Lord's Apostles...

就像尼哥底母和約瑟夫開始對他們主使徒的生命感到絕望一樣......

one of the Council, 

理事會的一名成員，

a well-known and highly respected teacher of the Law

一位著名且備受尊敬的法律教師

named Gamaliel,

名為迦瑪列，

who had remained seated while the others were expressing their outrage,

當其他人表達他們的憤怒時，他們仍然坐著，

rose calmly from his place.

平靜地從他的地方站起來。

A hush began to fall over the Council Hall, 

as Gamaliel signalled the Temple guards to remove the Apostles from the room.

Then, 

when all was quiet, 

he spoke.

💠

"Men, Israelites, take a moment 

and think carefully

about what you ought to do with these men."

A few who were standing 

began to resume their seats.

Gamaliel continued: 

"We've dealt with false messiahs before: remember Theudas?

He made great claims for himself, and about four hundred followed him. 

But when he was killed, all his followers were dispersed 

and the movement came to nothing."

More sat now, remembering.

"And after him, Judas from Galilee rose to prominence, in the days of the head tax enrollment; he attracted many followers!"

He looked around. 

"But when he died, all of his followers were scattered, too."

Heads nodded in sage agreement now, as nearly all were back in their seats.

💠

"So now, I say to you: 

Desist from these men, and leave them be. 

For if this movement is from man, 

it will come to an end and disappear."

Many of the Council felt calmer now -- even Caiaphas! --

at the thought of the false Messiah's movement 

dissolving on its own.

"But if it is from God, you will not be able to stop it.

You will only find yourselves

fighting 

against 

God."

💠

Based on Acts 5:33-39.
