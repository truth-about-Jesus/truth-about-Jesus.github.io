Peter stared at the poor beggar's outstretched hand, then at the man himself.

彼得盯著這個可憐的乞丐伸出的手，然後盯著那個男人自己。

\

It was clear he could not walk -- his feet and ankles shrivelled and misshapen.

很明顯，他不能走路——他的腳和腳踝萎縮和失形。

\

The Apostle fished in his pocket, but came up empty. He looked at John, who shook his head and spread his hands a little.

使徒檢查了口袋，什麼也沒找到。他看了看約翰，約翰搖了搖頭，微微攤開雙手。

\

Both were broke.

兩人都沒有錢。

\

Looking at the man's face, Peter saw downcast eyes.

彼得看著那人的臉，發現他的眼睛正低著。

\

A profound compassion rising up in his belly, the Apostle opened his mouth to speak:

深深的同情在他的肚子裡升起，使徒開口說：

\

*"Look at us."*

「看看我們。」

\

The words came gently, effortlessly, and Peter and John both knew:

這句話說慈，毫不費力，彼得和約翰都知道：

\

the wind of the Holy Spirit was picking up.

聖靈之風開始吹拂。

\
\

Azariah was startled.

阿撒利亞大吃一驚。

\

*Look* at them?!

看看他們？！

\

Most people just tossed him a careless coin or two and continued on their way --

大多數人只是粗心大意地向他扔了一兩枚硬幣，然後繼續前行——

\

barely noticing the lame man.

幾乎沒有注意到那個瘸子。

\

*What could these strangers want from him?*

這些陌生人能從他那裡得到什麼？

\

\
\

Slowly, fearfully, the crippled beggar raised shame-filled eyes,

慢慢地，害怕地，殘廢的乞丐抬起了充滿羞恥的眼睛，

\

as Peter and John waited patiently... prayerfully...

當彼得和約翰耐心地等待時......祈禱著......

\

both joyfully aware:

兩人都欣喜地意識到：

\

the Holy Spirit was about to do...

聖靈即將做......

\

something wonderful.

太棒了的某事。
