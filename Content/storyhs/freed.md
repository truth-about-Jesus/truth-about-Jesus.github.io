John looked around.

\

The angel had disappeared, yet he -- and all the Apostles -- *were still standing together in the darkened street!*

\

They stared at one another.

\

*Were they dreaming?*

\

Or were they really *free?*

They headed off toward the Temple

Caiaphas surveyed the Council Hall with satisfaction. 

該亞法滿意地調查了理事會大廳。

\

All were present and accounted for -- not hastily, but at his leisure. 

所有人都到齊了，人數都清點完畢──不是匆忙，而是在他有條不紊的情況下。

\

The Chief Priest had enjoyed the respite afforded by keeping the false Messiah's main followers in jail.

大祭司透過將假彌賽亞的主要追隨者關在監獄裡而享受了喘息。

\

However, it was time to deal with them sternly,

\

and end this atrocious movement,

once and for all.

He turned to the bailiff.

\

"Bring in the accused."

The bailiff nodded to the guards, who saluted smartly and exited the Council Hall. 

法庭監守向警衛點了點頭，衛兵們敬了個漂亮的軍禮，然後離開了議會大廳。

\

All waited patiently, some chatting quietly to their neighbour, shifting in their seats, arranging long robes. 

所有人都耐心地等待著，有些人靜靜地和鄰居聊天，在座位上挪動一下，整理長袍。

\

*Hmmm...*

誒......

\

The wait seemed to be taking longer than usual...!

等待的時間似乎比平時要長......！

\

At last, the guards returned emptyhanded, and one of them went straight to the bailiff and whispered in his ear.

最後，警衛們空手而歸，其中一個直接走到法庭監守那裡，在他耳邊低聲說。

\

The bailiff's eyes widened. 

法庭監守睜大了眼睛。

\

"Are you *sure?!"*

「你確定嗎？！」
