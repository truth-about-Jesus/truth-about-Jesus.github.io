As He broke through the tops of the clouds, Jesus spied Gabriel and Raphael waiting expectantly for their cue.

當耶穌衝破雲層時，他看到加百列和拉斐爾滿懷期待地等待著他們的暗示。

\

"You'd better go now," He advised them with a twinkle in His eye. "Don't want'em to get a crick in their necks."

「你最好現在就走，」他眼睛裡閃爍著眼睛勸告他們。 「別讓他們脖子扭傷了。」

\

The two angels grinned, saluted their King, and dropped gladly down through the clouds.

兩個天使咧嘴一笑，向他們的國王敬禮，然後高興地從雲層中落下。

As Jesus toured the Universe on His way home, He reminisced. 

當耶穌在回家的路上遊覽宇宙時，他回憶了。

\

He was relieved to have completed His undeniably difficult assignment -- the master plan He and His Father had devised together, long before creating the cosmos -- and with it, the Earth. 

他鬆了一口氣，因為他完成了不可否認的艱鉅任務——這是他和父親在創造宇宙和地球之前很久就共同製定的總體規劃。

\

Now all that remained was a triumphal tour of the Universe -- and a seat at His Father's right hand in Heaven. 

現在，他所要做的就是在宇宙中進行一次凱旋之旅——然後在天堂裡坐在他父親的右手邊。

\

The triumphal tour was optional, of course, but --

當然，凱旋之旅是可選的，但是——

\

Jesus always enjoyed visiting with the celestial beings...

耶穌總是喜歡拜訪天體......

\

known on earth as mere stars...

在地球上被稱為恆星......

\

They had such fascinating personalities.

他們的個性非常迷人。

As He flew on, Jesus thought about His chosen Apostles and disciples. 

當他飛翔時，耶穌想到了他揀選的使徒和門徒。

\

He hadn't been terribly surprised at the question that had revealed their continuing focus on conquest, despite His best efforts to show them a better way.

儘管他盡了最大努力向他們展示更好的方法，但這個問題揭示了他們繼續專注於征服，但他並沒有感到太驚訝。

\

So He had replied, gently and patiently, 

所以他溫柔而耐心地回答道，

\

"It is not for you to know the times or seasons the Father has appointed by His own authority --

「你們不必知道父憑著自己的權柄所定的時間或季節——

\

but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you will be My 

但當聖靈降臨在你身上時，你將得到力量，你將成為我的

in Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth."
