Over two thousand years ago, a poor Jewish rabbi amassed about 120 faithful followers -- before being executed by the religious authorities in Jerusalem.

兩千多年前，一位貧窮的猶太拉比聚集了大約 120 名忠實的追隨者，但隨後卻被耶路撒冷的宗教當局處決。

\

His disciples, devastated and demoralized by His death, disappeared into hiding. The fledgling movement seemed at an end.

他的門徒因他的死而悲痛欲絕，士氣低落，紛紛躲藏起來。這場非常年輕的運動似乎已經結束了。

\

However, seven weeks later, they reappeared unexpectedly as a force to be reckoned with, fearlessly announcing He had risen from death, calling all to repentance and faith, and persevering in the face of persecution, torture and death.

然而，七週後，他們作為一股不可忽視的力量意外地重新出現，無所畏懼地宣佈他已經從死裡復活，呼籲所有人悔改和信仰，並面對迫害、酷刑和死亡堅持不懈。

\

Today, billions of people across the globe, from all walks of life -- rich and poor, powerful and unknown, educated and illiterate -- claim to be His followers. 

今天，全球數十億人，來自各行各業——富人和窮人，有權勢和默默無聞，受過教育和文盲——聲稱自己是他的追隨者。

\

*Why?*

為什麼？

\

Before He left, their Master promised to send a Helper to take His place.

在他離開之前，他們的主人答應派一個幫手來代替他。

\

This is the story of the Holy Spirit.

這是聖靈的故事。
