*"Lock the doors!"* 

「把門鎖上！」

Caiaphas tried to keep the urgency out of his voice

\

as the entire Ruling Council hustled safely back into the Council Hall

\

with their unusually compliant prisoners.

\

*No sense in taking any chances.*

As the Council settled back into their seats and rearranged their robes,

\

the Apostles stood quietly in the midst.

\

They had not *intended* to escape...

\

but what else could one do --

faced with an angel sent by God?

\

Deep down inside they had known:

the Ruling Council,

like a dog with a bone,

\

would not give up so easily.

Once he had sufficiently recovered from their bold venture, the Chief Priest bristled with indignation.

一旦他從他們大膽的冒險中充分恢復過來，首席牧師就充滿了憤慨。

\

"Did we not strictly charge you," he began severely, "not to teach *anyone* in this name?" 

「我們不是嚴格命令你嗎，」他嚴厲地開始說，「不要以這個名義教任何人？」

\

He hated to think -- let alone *speak* -- the name of the false Messiah.

"And now, look! You've filled Jerusalem with your teaching; 

「現在，看！ 你用你的教誨填滿了耶路撒冷；

\

and you want to blame *us* 

你想責怪我們

\

for the blood of this man!"

enjoying the flow of supernatural peace through their hearts and minds,
