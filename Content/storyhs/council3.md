Caiaphas shuddered at the awful memory,

該亞法對這可怕的記憶感到不寒而慄，

\

pulled himself together,

鎮定下來，

\

and returned his attention to the three men standing before the Council,

並把注意力回到站在理事會面前的三個人身上，

\

as the Holy Spirit concluded, through John, His remarks about Jesus:

正如聖靈透過約翰完成了他對耶穌的評論：

\

"Salvation cannot be found in *anyone else,* 

「救贖不能在其他人身上找到，

\

for there is *no other* name under Heaven

因為天堂下沒有其他名字

\

given to mankind,

給人類，

\

by which we must be saved."

我們必須因此得救。」

\

\
\

One of the three standing before the Council was well known to all of them: 

站在理事會面前的三個人中，有一個人是理事會裡大家都很熟悉的：

\

Azariah, the man crippled from birth, who had formerly sat every day 

亞撒利雅，這個從出生起就殘廢的人，以前每天都坐著

\

at the Temple gate begging --

在聖殿門口乞討——

\

but now -- undeniably, miraculously healed.

但現在——不可否認，奇蹟般地痊癒了。

\

The other two were clearly common men who had never learned to read or write --

另外兩個人顯然是窮人，從未學過讀書寫字——

\

*some of the Galilean rabbi's ragtag followers, apparently!*

顯然，加利利拉比的一些雜七雜八的追隨者！

\

Yet here they were, in an unthinkable fusion of miracle, courage and eloquence.

然而，他們在這裡，在奇蹟、勇氣和口才的不可思議的融合中。

\

\
\

Caiaphas shook his head.

該亞法搖了搖頭。

\

*What to do?*

怎麼辦？

\

The other members of the Ruling Council were silent.

執政理事會的其他成員保持沉默。

\

*What could they say?*

他們能說什麼？

\

After a long pause, the Chief Priest signalled the Temple guards.

停頓了很久之後，首席牧師向聖殿守衛手勢。

\

"Remove them." 

「把他們帶出房間。」

\

\
\

*Based on Acts 4:5-7,12-15.*

基於使徒行傳4:5-7,12-15。
