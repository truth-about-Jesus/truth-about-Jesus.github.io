Just before leaving the cover of the clouds, Gabriel and Raphael checked to make sure they were invisible. 

在離開雲層之前，加布里埃爾和拉斐爾檢查了一下，以確保他們是隱形的。

\

Now descending unseen, they saw a crowd of about 120 men, along with numerous women and children, all staring up at them --

現在在看不見的情況下下降，他們看到大約120名男子的人群，以及許多婦女和兒童，都盯著他們——

\

not really at *them,* of course, because *they* were invisible --

當然，不是真的對他們，因為他們是看不見的——

\

but at the clouds, which had hidden their Master from sight. 

但在雲層上，雲層遮住了他們的主人。

The two angels dropped down lightly a distance behind the disciples, so as not to cause a panic.

兩位天使輕輕地降落在門徒身後一段距離，以免引起恐慌。

\

All in the heavenly realms -- both faithful and fallen -- were well-aware of the mortals' peculiar propensity to terror.

所有在天堂領域——無論是忠實的還是墮落的——都深知凡人特別容易受到恐懼。

\

Gabriel -- then Raphael -- turned on visibility, so they could be seen -- *excepting their wings, of course!* -- and quietly joined the crowd.

加布裡埃爾——然後是拉斐爾——開啟能見度，這樣就可以看到他們了——當然，除了他們的翅膀！——然後悄悄地加入了人群。

\

Then Gabriel spoke clearly:

然後加布里埃爾清晰地說：

\

"Men of Galilee, why do you stand here, gazing into the sky? This Jesus, who went up from you into Heaven, will return in the same way you saw Him leave."

「加利利人，你們為什麼站在這裡，凝視著天空？ 這位從你那裡升到天堂的耶穌，將以你看到他離開的方式回來。」
